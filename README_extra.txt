README_extra.txt for version 7.0 of Vim: Vi IMproved.

The extra archive of Vim is to be used in combination with the source archive
(vim-7.0-src.tar.gz).  The extra archive is useless without it.

For more information, see the "README.txt" file that comes with the runtime
archive (vim-7.0-rt.tar.gz).  To be able to run Vim you MUST get the runtime
archive too!

The extra archive plus the source and runtime achives make up the complete
sources of Vim for all systems.
