Interactive table of contents for help buffers and several other filetypes

==============================================================================


1. OVERVIEW						*HelpToc-overview*

The helptoc.vim plugin provides one command, :HelpToc, which generates a
hierarchical table of contents in a popup window, which is based on the
structure of a Vim buffer.  It was designed initially for help buffers,
but it also works with buffers of the following types:
	- asciidoc
	- html
	- man
	- markdown
	- terminal
	- tex
	- vim		Note: only with numbered fold markers, e.g. {{{1
	- xhtml

1.1 The :HelpToc command				*HelpToc-:HelpToc*

The :HelpToc command takes no arguments and it cannot be executed from an
unsupported filetype.  Also, it cannot be used to generate a table of contents
for an inactive buffer.

For most buffers of the supported types, :HelpToc may be entered directly
in Vim's |Command-line-mode|.  How to use it from Vim's |Terminal-Job| mode is
explained in |HelpToc-terminal-buftype|.

You may choose to map :HelpToc to keys making it easier to use.  These are
examples of what could be used: >

	nnoremap <Leader>ht <Cmd>HelpToc<CR>
	tnoremap <C-t><C-t> <Cmd>HelpToc<CR>
<

2. DETAILS						*HelpToc-details*

When the :HelpToc command is executed from an active buffer of a supported
type, a popup window is produced.  The window contains a hierarchical and
interactive table of contents.  The entries are based on the "headings" in
the buffer.

Jumping to an entry's position in the buffer can be achieved by pressing
enter on the applicable entry.  Navigation, and other commands applicable to
the popup window, such as expanding and contracting levels, fuzzy searching,
and jumping to the previous or next entry (leaving the table of contents
itself displayed, using J and K), is provided at |help-TOC|, so that is not
reproduced in this help file.


3. TYPES						*HelpToc-types*

Some filetypes have more predictable structures than others.  For example,
markdown and asciidoc make the identification of headings (aside from edge
cases, such as when in quotes) straightforward.  Some filetypes do not have
such obvious or reliable headings/levels (particularly help buffers).
Further, in some instances, how to enter the :HelpToc command is not
necessarily obvious, e.g., when in a Vim |terminal-window|.  So, the following
headings address specific details regarding the in-scope types.

3.1 asciidoc					*HelpToc-asciidoc-filetype*

The heading levels in asciidoc are typically identified by lines starting
with a "=" (up to six, one per level), one or more blank characters, and the
heading text.  :HelpToc will generate a table of contents based on either
that form of heading type or, because asciidoc also allows for ATX heading
level syntax (i.e., using the "#" character), headings using that format too.

As asciidoc is very structured, its table of contents entries are presented
in a standardized form - see |HelpToc-standardized-toc|.  So, the initial
"=" or "#" characters and the following space from the related heading are
not included in the table of contents' entries.

3.2 html					*HelpToc-html-filetype*

HTML provides for six levels of headings, <h1> to <h6>, which may be either
upper or lower case and preceded by all sorts of content like <!--comments-->.
:HelpToc will produce a table of contents based on the six heading levels.

As HTML is very structured, its table of contents entries are presented
in a standardized form - see |HelpToc-standardized-toc|.  So, the <h1> to <h6>
tags, any preceding content, and any trailing content after the heading text,
is not included in the table of contents' entries.

3.3 man pages					*HelpToc-man-filetype*

Retrieving man pages is typically performed in the terminal.  To use :HelpToc
to generate a table of contents, the |man.vim| filetype plugin is a
prerequisite.  It is provided with Vim, and may be sourced with: >

	:runtime ftplugin/man.vim
<
Once sourced, the |:Man| command will open the applicable man page in a new
buffer (of "man" filetype).  For example: >

	:Man pwd
<
Once in the man buffer, entering :HelpToc opens the table of contents popup,
with level 1 containing section names like NAME, SYNOPSIS, etc.  Levels
below 1 include subsections and options, with the level depending on the
number of spaces preceding the content.

The table of contents for a man buffer's popup window has the same syntax
highlighting as man pages.  This reflects that its content is reproduced
as-is, i.e., no preceding tags, level-indicating data, etc., need be omitted
for optimal presentation.

3.4 markdown					*HelpToc-markdown-filetype*

The headings and levels in markdown typically are ATX formatted headings
(lines starting with up to three spaces, one to six "#", then (optionally)
one or blank characters and the heading text).  The alternate form,
setext, uses up to three spaces, the heading 1 text, followed by a
line of one or more "=".  The setext heading 2 is similar, but for one or
more "-" instead of "=".  There is no heading 3+ in setext.  ATX and setext
headings are supported.

As markdown is very structured, its table of contents entries are presented
in a standardized form - see |HelpToc-standardized-toc|.  So, they do not
include any leading spaces, any initial "#" characters and the following blank
character(s) in the table of contents' entries.

3.5 terminal					*HelpToc-terminal-buftype*

There are no explicit "headings" for a terminal buffer.  However, :HelpToc
displays the history of executed shell commands.  Those may be specified
by changing the pattern used to match the Vim terminal's prompt.
See |HelpToc-configuration| for examples.

To access the terminal's table of contents, from the Vim's |Terminal-Job| mode
enter CTRL-W N to go to |Terminal-Normal| mode.  From there, enter :HelpToc to
generate the table of contents.  If you use the terminal's table of contents
a lot, an appropriate mapping may make it easier than using CTRL-W N - e.g.: >

          tnoremap <C-t><C-t> <Cmd>HelpToc<CR>
<
As the terminal has only "level 1", the table of contents is presented in a
standardized form - see |HelpToc-standardized-toc| - including only the history
list of commands.  The prompt itself is also omitted since it adds no value
repeating it for every entry.

3.6 tex						*HelpToc-tex-filetype*

In LaTeX, a document may be structured hierarchically using part, chapter,
and sectioning commands.  Document structure levels are:
	\part{}
	\chapter{}
	\section{}
	\subsection{}
	\subsubsection{}

To keep things simpler, \part{} is supported, though treated as being at
the same level as chapter.  Consequently, there are four levels displayed
for a tex filetype's table of contents, regardless of the \documentclass{},
i.e., part and chapter (at level 1), section (level 2), subsection (level 3),
and subsubsection (level 4).

Also supported are:
	- The "*" used to produce unnumbered headings, which are not intended
	  for reproduction in a table of contents: >
		\section*{Unnumbered section heading not produced in the TOC}
<	- Manual toc entries using \addcontentsline, for example: >
		\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{entry in the TOC only!}
<
The table of contents for a tex filetype is in a standardized form -
see |HelpToc-standardized-toc|.  Omitted are: the "\", the part, chapter,
*section, or addcontentsline, and the left and right curly
brackets preceding and following each heading's text.

3.7 vim						*HelpToc-vim-filetype*

Vimscript and Vim9 script do not have headings or levels inherently like
markup languages.  However, Vim provides for |folds| defined by markers (|{{{|),
which themselves may be succeeded by a number explicitly indicating the fold
level.  This is the structure recognized and supported by helptoc.vim.
So, for example, the following would produce three table of contents entries: >

	vim9script
	# Variables {{{1
	var b: bool = true
	var s: string = $"Fold markers are great?  {b}!"
	# Functions {{{1
	def MyFunction(): void #{{{2
	  echo s
	enddef
	MyFunction()
<
The table of contents for that script would appear like this:
	Variables
	Functions
	| MyFunction(): void

Note: The numbered |{{{| marker structure is the only one supported by
      helptoc.vim for the vim filetype.

As the {{{1 to {{{6 markers make the "headings" explicit, the table of
contents is in a standardized form - see |HelpToc-standardized-toc|.
It does not include any leading comment markers (i.e., either # or ") and
omits the markers themselves.

3.8 xhtml					*HelpToc-xhtml-filetype*

Although XHTML, being XML, is more strictly structured than HTML/HTML5,
there is no practical difference in treatment required for the xhtml filetype
because, at the heading level, the tags that matter are very similar.
See |HelpToc-html-filetype| for how an xhtml filetype's table of contents is
supported.


4. STANDARDIZED TOC				*HelpToc-standardized-toc*

The table of contents for a help buffer, terminal, or man page, make sense
being presented in the form they appear, minus trailing content (such as tags).

The table of contents for a markdown, asciidoc, [x]html, terminal, or tex
buffer have superfluous content if the entire line was to be returned.
For example:
- Markdown has "#" characters before headings when using ATX heading notation.
- Asciidoc will have either those or, more often, "=" characters before its
  headings.
- HTML, aside from the "<h" headings, may have additional tags, comments,
  and whitespace before its headings.
- The Vim terminal has the shell prompt, which adds nothing if repeated for
  every heading (and may be very long).
- LaTeX has "\" level indicators like "\section{" and a trailing "}".
Consequently, standardising these filetypes' tables of contents, removing
the "noise", and indicating the contents level of each entry, makes sense.

HelpToc standardizes the markdown, asciidoc, [x]html, terminal and tex tables
of contents by removing extraneous characters, markup indicators, and tags.
It also applies simple, unobtrusive syntax highlighting to the text and level
indicators.  By default, it will appear like the following example (though
any level indicators will be less prominent, using |NonText| highlight group).

	Level 1
	| Level 2
	| | Level 3
	| | | Level 4
	| | | | Level 5
	| | | | | Level 6

Note: The "| " level indicator may be changed - see |HelpToc-configuration|.


5. CONFIGURATION				*HelpToc-configuration*

All configuration is achieved utilizing the g:helptoc dictionary.  Any of the
following may be adjusted to meet your needs or preferences:

g:helptoc key	 what it controls
-------------	 ----------------
shell_prompt	 The terminal prompt, used for creating a table of contents
		 for the terminal (history list).  The default is,
		 '^\w\+@\w\+:\f\+\$\s', which should match many users' bash
		 prompt.  To change it, either interactively or in your .vimrc,
		 use (for example for a bare Bourne shell "$ " prompt): >
			vim9 g:helptoc.shell_prompt = '^\$\s'

<level_indicator  This key's value controls the level indicator used in
		 standardized tables of contents.  The default is '| '
		 (i.e., a vertical bar and a space), but may be changed to
		 whatever you want.  For example, for a broken bar and space: >
			vim9 g:helptoc.level_indicator = '¦ '
<
popup_border	 By default, the table of contents border will appear above,
		 right, below, and left of the popup window.  If you prefer
		 not to have the border on the right and left (for example
		 only), you can achieve that with: >
			vim9 g:helptoc.popup_border = [1, 0, 1, 0]
<popup_borderchars
		 The default border characters for the table of contents popup
		 window is the list ['─', '│', '─', '│', '┌', '┐', '┘', '└'].
		 There's nothing wrong with those box drawing characters,
		 though, for example, if you wanted a border that only uses
		 ASCII characters, you could make the border spaces only: >
			vim9 g:helptoc.popup_borderchars = [' ']
<popup_borderhighlight
		 The default border highlight group is Normal.  You can change
		 that, perhaps in combination with popup_borderchars, above,
		 to create a very clearly prominent border.  For example, if
		 the popup_borderchars are made [' '], like above, the border
		 could be made a solid colour different to the background
		 with: >
			vim9 g:helptoc.popup_borderhighlight = ['Cursor']

<			  Note: Choosing a highlight group that persists when
				colorschemes change may be a good idea if you
				do choose to customize this.

popup_drag	By default, table of contents popup windows may be dragged
		with a mouse.  If you want to prevent that from happening,
		for whatever reason, you may deactivate it with: >
			vim9 g:helptoc.popup_drag = false
<
popup_close	Table of contents popups have "none" as the default setting
		for this option.  If you use a mouse, you may want either
		to have the option to close popup windows by clicking on them
		or to have a clickable "X" in the top right corner.  For the
		former, use "click", and for the latter, use "button", e.g.: >
			vim9 g:helptoc.popup_close = "button"
<popup_scrollbar
		No scrollbar is provided on helptoc popups by default.  If you
		do want scrollbars (which may be useful as an indicator of how
		far through the table of contents you are, not just for using
		with a mouse) you may choose to have them with: >
			vim9 g:helptoc.popup_scrollbar = true
<
NOTE: Information about the "popup_*" options, above, relate to popup options,
which are explained at the 'second argument' part of |popup_create-arguments|.


6. LIMITATIONS					*HelpToc-limitations*

- The help filetype may have edge case formatting patterns.  Those may result
  in some "headings" not being identified and/or may impact the heading levels
  of entries in the table of contents itself.
- Terminal window table of contents may not be active (insofar as jumping to
  entries going to the Vim terminal's related command line).  For example, if
  Vim's terminal is set to Windows PowerShell Core, the table of contents will
  display successfully, though the entries go nowhere when Enter, J, or K are
  entered on them.
- The tex filetype may have variable sectioning commands depending on the
  document class.  Consequently, some compromises are made, though they should
  have minimal impact.  Specifically:
  * In instances where \part{} and \chapter{} appear in the same buffer, they
    will both present at the top level in the table of contents.  This should
    be a minor matter because, in many instances, chapters will be in a
    separate document using \include{}.
  * An article or beamer \documentclass without a \part{} (or any document
    with neither any \part{} nor any \chapter{} command) will have no content
    at level 1.  Consequently, its table of contents entries will all appear
    preceded by at least one "| " (by default) because its headings start at
    level 2 (presuming \section{} is present).
- The vim filetype is only supported where numbered fold markers are applied.
  This is intentional (including not handling unnumbered markers, which, when
  used in combination with numbered ones, may be used for folding comments).
  helptoc.vim itself provides an exemplar of how to use numbered fold markers,
  not only for folds, but to support generating a useful table of contents
  using :HelpToc.
