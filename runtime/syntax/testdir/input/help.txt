VIM HELP FILE FORMAT


Issue #17721 (Strange >vim highlighting in help documentation?)~

				*restore-cursor* *last-position-jump*  >vim
    augroup RestoreCursor
      autocmd!
      autocmd BufReadPost *
        \ let line = line("'\"")
        \ | if line >= 1 && line <= line("$") && &filetype !~# 'commit'
        \      && index(['xxd', 'gitrebase'], &filetype) == -1
        \      && !&diff
        \ |   execute "normal! g`\""
        \ | endif
    augroup END

By default the following indentation options are set, in accordance with Zig's
recommended style (https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/): >


NOTE, WARNING and DEPRECATED~

When you 'send a file to Vim', Vim changes to that file's directory.  Note,
however, that any long directory names will appear in their short (MS-DOS)
form on some Windows versions.  This is a limitation of the Windows "Send To"
mechanism.


EXAMPLE LANGUAGES~
							*vim9-mix*
There is one way to use both legacy and Vim9 syntax in one script file: >vim9

	" legacy Vim script comments may go here
	if !has('vim9script')
	   " legacy Vim script commands go here
	   finish
	endif
	vim9script
	# Vim9 script commands go here

This allows for writing a script that takes advantage of the Vim9 script
syntax if possible, but will also work on a Vim version without it.
