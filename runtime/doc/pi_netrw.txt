The functionality mentioned here is done via using |standard-plugin|
techniques.  This plugin is only available if

	set nocp                    " 'compatible' is not set
	filetype plugin on          " plugins are enabled

You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_netrw" variable
in your <.vimrc> file: >

	:let loaded_netrw = 1

{Vi does not have any of this}

1. Netrw Reference						*netrw-ref*

    OPTIONS
	let g:netrw_ftp =0 use ftp (default)		     (uid password)
			=1 use alternate ftp method	(user uid password)
	  If you're having trouble with ftp, try changing the value
	  of this variable in your <.vimrc> to change methods

	let g:netrw_ignorenetrc= 1
	  If you have a <.netrc> file but it doesn't work and you
	  want it ignored, then set this variable as shown.  Its mere
	  existence is enough to cause <.netrc> to be ignored.

	Attempts to use ftp will prompt you for a user-id and a password.
	These will be saved in g:netrw_uid and g:netrw_passwd Subsequent uses
	of ftp will re-use those.  If you need to use a different user id
	and/or password, you'll want to call NetUserPass() first.

	:NetUserPass [uid [password]]		-- prompts as needed
	:call NetUserPass()			-- prompts for uid and password
	:call NetUserPass("uid")		-- prompts for password
	:call NetUserPass("uid","password")	-- sets global uid and password

==============================================================================
2. Network-Oriented File Transfer				*netrw-xfer*

Network-oriented file transfer under Vim is implemented by a VimL-based script
(<netrw.vim>) using plugin techniques.  It currently supports both reading
and writing across networks using rcp, scp, ftp or ftp+<.netrc>, scp, fetch,
dav/cadaver, rsync, or sftp.

http is currently supported read-only via use of wget or fetch.

<netrw.vim> is a standard plugin which acts as glue between Vim and the
various file transfer programs.  It uses autocommand events (BufReadCmd,
FileReadCmd, BufWriteCmd) to intercept reads/writes with url-like filenames. >

	ex. vim ftp://hostname/path/to/file
<
The characters preceding the colon specify the protocol to use;
in the example, its ftp.  The <netrw.vim> script then formulates
a command or a series of commands (typically ftp) which it issues
to an external program (ftp, scp, etc) which does the actual file
transfer/protocol.  Files are read from/written to a temporary file
(under Unix/Linux, /tmp/...) which the <netrw.vim> script will
clean up.

One may modify any protocol's implementing external application
by settinbg a variable (ex. scp uses the variable g:netrw_scp_cmd,
which is defaulted to "scp -q").

Ftp, an old protocol, seems to be blessed by numerous implementations.
Unfortunately, some implementations are noisy (ie., add junk to the end
of the file).  Thus, concerned users may decide to write a NetReadFixup()
function that will clean up after reading with their ftp.  Some Unix systems
(ie., FreeBSD) provide a utility called "fetch" which uses the ftp protocol
but is not noisy and more convenient, actually, for <netrw.vim> to use.
Consequently, if "fetch" is executable, it will be used to do reads for
ftp://... (and http://...) .  See |netrw-var| for more about this.

For rcp, scp, sftp, and http, one may use network-oriented file transfers
transparently; ie.
>
	vim rcp://[user@]machine/path
	vim scp://[user@]machine/path
<
If your ftp supports <.netrc>, then it too can be just as transparently used
if the needed triad of machine name, user id, and password are present in
that file.  Your ftp must be able to use the <.netrc> file on its own, however.
>
	vim ftp://[user@]machine[[:#]portnumber]/path
<
However, ftp will often need to query the user for the userid and password.
The latter will be done "silently"; ie. asterisks will show up instead of
the actually-typed-in password.  Netrw will retain the userid and password
for subsequent read/writes from the most recent transfer so subsequent
transfers (read/write) to or from that machine will take place without
additional prompting.

  +=================================+============================+============+

	(*1) For an absolute path use scp://machine//path.

	(*2) if <.netrc> is present, it is assumed that it will
	work with your ftp client.  Otherwise the script will
	prompt for user-id and pasword.

        (*3) for ftp, "machine" may be machine#port or machine:port
	if a different port is needed than the standard ftp port

	(*4) for http:..., if wget is available it will be used.  Otherwise,
	if fetch is available it will be used.

Both the :Nread and the :Nwrite ex-commands can accept multiple filenames.


NETRC							*netrw-netrc*

The typical syntax for lines in a <.netrc> file is given as shown below.
Ftp under Unix usually support <.netrc>; Windows' ftp usually doesn't.
>
	machine {full machine name} login {user-id} password "{password}"
	default login {user-id} password "{password}"

Your ftp client must handle the use of <.netrc> on its own, but if the
<.netrc> file exists, an ftp transfer will not ask for the user-id or
password.

	Note:
	Since this file contains passwords, make very sure nobody else can
	read this file!  Most programs will refuse to use a .netrc that is
	readable for others.  Don't forget that the system administrator can
	still read the file!


PASSWORD						*netrw-passwd*

The script attempts to get passwords for ftp invisibly using |inputsecret()|,
a built-in Vim function.  See |netrw-uidpass| for how to change the password
after one has set it.

Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a way for netrw to feed a password
to scp.  Thus every transfer via scp will require re-entry of the password.


==============================================================================
3. Activation						*netrw-activate*

Network-oriented file transfers are available by default whenever
|'nocompatible'| mode is enabled.  The <netrw.vim> file resides in your
system's vim-plugin directory and is sourced automatically whenever you
bring up vim.


==============================================================================
4. Transparent File Transfer				*netrw-transparent*

Transparent file transfers occur whenever a regular file read or write
(invoked via an |:autocmd| for |BufReadCmd| or |BufWriteCmd| events) is made.
Thus one may use files across networks as if they were local. >

	vim ftp://[user@]machine/path
	...
	:wq


==============================================================================
5. Ex Commands						*netrw-ex*

The usual read/write commands are supported.  There are also a couple of
additional commands available.

:[range]Nw	Write the specified lines to the current
		file as specified in b:netrw_lastfile.

:[range]Nw {netfile} [{netfile}]...
		Write the specified lines to the {netfile}.

:Nread
		Read the specified lines into the current
		buffer from the file specified in
		b:netrw_lastfile.

:Nread {netfile} {netfile}...
		Read the {netfile} after the current line.

									*netrw-uidpass*
:call NetUserPass()
		If b:netrw_uid and b:netrw_passwd don't exist,
		this function query the user for them.

:call NetUserPass("userid")
		This call will set the b:netrw_uid and, if
		the password doesn't exist, will query the user for it.

:call NetUserPass("userid","passwd")
		This call will set both the b:netrw_uid and b:netrw_passwd.
		The user-id and password are used by ftp transfers.  One may
		effectively remove the user-id and password by using ""
		strings.


==============================================================================
6. Variables and Options       			*netrw-options* *netrw-var*

The script <netrw.vim> uses several variables which can affect <netrw.vim>'s
behavior.  These variables typically may be set in the user's <.vimrc> file:
>
                                -------------
                           	Netrw Options

	                           if you have a <.netrc> file but you don't
				   want it used, then set this variable.  Its
				   mere existence is enough to cause <.netrc>
				   to be ignored.
        b:netrw_lastfile        Holds latest method/machine/path.

The first two options both help with certain ftp's that give trouble otherwise.
In order to best understand how to use these options if ftp is giving you
troubles, a bit of discussion follows on how netrw does ftp reads.

The g:netrw_..._cmd variables specify the external program to use handle
the associated protocol (rcp, ftp, etc), plus any options.

The g:netrw_list_cmd's HOSTNAME entry will be changed via substitution with
whatever the current request is for a hostname.

For ftp, netrw typically builds up lines of one of the following formats in a
temporary file:

Netrw then executes the lines above by use of a filter:
>
	:%! {g:netrw_ftp_cmd} -i [-n]
<

where
	g:netrw_ftp_cmd is usually "ftp",
	-i tells ftp not to be interactive
	-n means don't use netrc and is used for Method #3 (ftp w/o <.netrc>)

If <.netrc> exists it will be used to avoid having to query the user for
userid and password.  The transferred file is put into a temporary file.
The temporary file is then read into the main editing session window that
requested it and the temporary file deleted.

If your ftp doesn't accept the "user" command and immediately just demands
a userid, then try putting "let netrw_ftp=1" in your <.vimrc>.

							 	*netrw-fixup*
If your ftp for whatever reason generates unwanted lines (such as AUTH
messages) you may write a NetReadFixup(tmpfile) function:
>
    function! NetReadFixup(method,line1,line2)
      " a:line1: first new line in current file
      " a:line2: last  new line in current file
      if     a:method == 1 "rcp
      elseif a:method == 2 "ftp + <.netrc>
      elseif a:method == 3 "ftp + machine,uid,password,filename
      elseif a:method == 4 "scp
      elseif a:method == 5 "http/wget
      elseif a:method == 6 "dav/cadaver
      elseif a:method == 7 "rsync
      elseif a:method == 8 "fetch
      elseif a:method == 9 "sftp
      else               " complain
      endif
    endfunction
>
The NetReadFixup() function will be called if it exists and thus allows
you to customize your reading process.  As a further example, <netrw.vim>
contains just such a function to handle Windows 95 ftp.  For whatever
reason, Windows 95's ftp dumps four blank lines at the end of a transfer,
and so it is desirable to automate their removal.  Here's some code taken
from <netrw.vim> itself:
>
    if has("win95") && g:netrw_win95ftp
     fun! NetReadFixup(method, line1, line2)
       if method == 3   " ftp (no <.netrc>)
        let fourblanklines= line2 - 3
        silent fourblanklines.",".line2."g/^\s*/d"
       endif
     endfunction
    endif

	---			-----------
	Var			Explanation
	---			-----------
	g:netrw_list_cmd	supports listing
	g:netrw_rm_cmd		supports removing files
	g:netrw_rmf_cmd		supports removing softlinks to directories
	g:netrw_rmdir_cmd	supports removing directories
	g:netrw_winsize		specify initial size of new o/v windows
	g:netrw_list_hide	comma separated list of patterns for

<
Netrw supports the browsing of directories on remote hosts, including
generating listing directories, entering directories, editing files
therein, deleting files/directories, and moving (renaming) files and
directories.

To enter the netrw directory browser, simply attempt to read a "file" with a
trailing slash and it will be interpreted as a request to list a directory:

	vim [protocol]://[user@]hostname/path/

Netrw will modify the command in g:netrw_list_cmd to perform the directory
listing operation.  By default the command is:

	ssh HOSTNAME ls -FLa

where the HOSTNAME becomes the [user@]hostname as requested by the attempt
to read.  Naturally, the user may override this command with whatever is
preferred.  The NetList function which implements remote directory
browsing expects that directories will be flagged by a trailing slash.

Browsing is simple: move the cursor onto a file or directory of interest.
Hitting the <cr> (the return key) will select the file or directory.
Directories will themselves be listed, and files will be opened using the
protocol given in the original read request.

						*netrw-delete* *netrw-remove*

Deleting/removing files and directories involves moving the cursor to the
file/directory to be deleted and pressing "D".  Directories must be empty
first before they can be successfully removed.  If the directory is a softlink
to a directory, then netrw will make two requests to remove the directory
before succeeding.  Netrw will ask for confirmation before doing the
removal(s).  You may select a range of lines with the "V" command (visual
selection), and then pressing "D".

The g:netrw_rm_cmd, g:netrw_rmf_cmd, and g:netrw_rmdir_cmd variables are
used to control the attempts to remove files and directories.  The
g:netrw_rm_cmd is used with files, and its default value is:

	g:netrw_rm_cmd: ssh HOSTNAME rm

The g:netrw_rmdir_cmd is used with directories.  Its default value is:

	g:netrw_rmdir_cmd: ssh HOSTNAME rmdir

If removing a directory fails with g:netrw_rmdir_cmd, netrw then will attempt
to remove it again using the g:netrw_rmf_cmd.  Its default value is:

	g:netrw_rmf_cmd: ssh HOSTNAME rm -f

								*netrw-x*

The Netrw executor applies a user-defined function to a file, based on its
extension.  Of course, the handler function must exist for it to be called.
>
	Ex. mypgm.html   x ->  NetrwFileHandler_html("scp://user@host/some/path/mypgm.html")
<
See the <NetrwFileHandlers.vim>

						*netrw-move* *netrw-rename*

Renaming/moving files and directories involves moving the cursor to the
file/directory to be moved (renamed) and pressing "R".  You will then be
queried for where you want the file/directory to be moved.  You may select a
range of lines with the "V" command (visual selection), and then pressing "R".

The g:netrw_rename_cmd is used to implement renaming.  By default its
value is:

	ssh HOSTNAME mv

							*netrw-list-hack*
For Linux/Unix systems, I suggest looking into

	http://hacks.oreilly.com/pub/h/66

It gives a tip for setting up password-less use of ssh and scp, and discusses
the associated security issues.

8. Debugging						*netrw-debug*

The <netrw.vim> script is typically available as:

	/usr/local/share/vim/vim6x/plugin/netrw.vim

which is loaded automatically at startup (assuming :set nocp).

	1. Get the <Decho.vim> script, available as:

		http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#vimlinks_scripts
		as "Decho, a vimL debugging aid"
	   or
		http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=120

	   and put it into your local plugin directory

	2. Edit the <netrw.vim> file as follows:

		:DechoOn

	   (to restore to normal, use  :DechoOff )

	3. Then bring up vim and attempt a transfer.  A set of messages
	   should appear concerning the steps that <netrw.vim> took in
	   attempting to read/write your file over the network.  Please
	   send that information to <netrw.vim>'s maintainer,

9. History						*netrw-history*

	v47: * 
	v46: * now handles remote directory browsing
	     * g:netrw_silent (if 1) will cause all transfers to be silent'd
	v45: * made the [user@]hostname:path form a bit more restrictive
	       to better handle errors in using protocols
	       (e.g. scp:usr@host:file was being recognized as an rcp request)
	v44: * changed from "rsync -a" to just "rsync"
	     * somehow an editing error messed up the test to recognize
	       use of the fetch method for NetRead.
	     * more debugging statements included
	v43: * moved "Explanation" comments to <pi_netrw.txt> help file
	       as "Network Reference" (|netrw-ref|)
	     * <netrw.vim> now uses Dfunc() Decho() and Dret() for debugging
	     * removed superfluous NetRestorePosn() calls
	v42: * now does BufReadPre and BufReadPost events on file:///*
	       and file://localhost/*
	v41: * installed file:///* and file://localhost/* handling
	v40: * prevents redraw when a protocol error occurs so that the
	       user may see it
	v39: * sftp support
	v38: * Now uses NetRestorePosn() calls with Nread/Nwrite commands
	     * Temporary files now removed via bwipe! instead of bwipe
	       (thanks to Dave Roberts)
	v37: * Claar's modifications which test if ftp is successful, otherwise
	       give an error message
	     * After a read, the alternate file was pointing to the temp file.
	       The temp file buffer is now wiped out.
	     * removed silent from transfer methods so user can see what's
	       happening
