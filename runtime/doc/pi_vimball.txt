2. Vimball Manual					*vimball-manual*

							*:MkVimball*
		:[range]MkVimball[!] filename [path]

	The range is composed of lines holding paths to files to be included
	in your new vimball.  As an example: >
		plugin/something.vim
		doc/something.txt
<	using >
		:[range]MkVimball filename
<
	on this range of lines will create a file called "filename.vba" which
	can be used by Vimball.vim to re-create these files.  If the
	"filename.vba" file already exists, then MkVimball will issue a
	warning and not create the file.  Note that these paths are relative
	to your .vim (vimfiles) directory, and the files should be in that
	directory.  The vimball plugin normally uses the first |'runtimepath'|
	directory that exists as a prefix; don't use absolute paths, unless
	the user has specified such a path.
							*g:vimball_home*
	You may override the use of the |'runtimepath'| by specifying a
	variable, g:vimball_home.

	If you use the exclamation point (!), then MkVimball will create the
	"filename.vba" file, overwriting it if it already exists.  This
	behavior resembles that for |:w|.

							*vimball-extract*
		vim filename.vba

	Simply editing a Vimball will cause Vimball.vim to tell the user to
	source the file to extract its contents.

	Extraction will only proceed if the first line of a putative vimball
	file holds the "Vimball Archiver by Charles E. Campbell, Jr., Ph.D."
	line.

		:VimballList				*:VimballList*

	This command will tell Vimball to list the files in the archive, along
	with their lengths in lines.

		:UseVimball [path]			*:UseVimball*

	This command is contained within the vimball itself; it invokes the
	vimball#Vimball() routine which is responsible for unpacking the
	vimball.  One may choose to execute it by hand instead of sourcing
	the vimball; one may also choose to specify a path for the
	installation, thereby overriding the automatic choice of the first
	existing directory on the |'runtimepath'|.

		:RmVimball vimballfile [path]		*:RmVimball*

	This command removes all files generated by the specified vimball
	(but not any directories it may have made).  One may choose a path
	for de-installation, too (see |'runtimepath'|); otherwise, the
	default is the first existing directory on the |'runtimepath'|.
	To implement this, a file (.VimballRecord) is made in that directory
	containing a record of what files need to be removed for all vimballs
	used thus far.

3. Vimball History					*vimball-history* {{{1

	22 : Mar 21, 2007 * uses setlocal instead of set during BufEnter
	21 : Nov 27, 2006 * (tnx to Bill McCarthy) vimball had a header
	                    handling problem and it now changes \s to /s
	20 : Nov 20, 2006 * substitute() calls have all had the 'e' flag
	                    removed.
	18 : Aug 01, 2006 * vimballs now use folding to easily display their
	                    contents.
			  * if a user has AsNeeded/somefile, then vimball
			    will extract plugin/somefile to the AsNeeded/
			    directory
	17 : Jun 28, 2006 * changes all \s to /s internally for Windows
	16 : Jun 15, 2006 * A. Mechelynck's idea to allow users to specify
			    installation root paths implemented for
			    UseVimball, MkVimball, and RmVimball.
			  * RmVimball implemented
	15 : Jun 13, 2006 * bugfix
	14 : May 26, 2006 * bugfixes
	13 : May 01, 2006 * exists("&acd") used to determine if the acd
			    option exists
	12 : May 01, 2006 * bugfix - the |'acd'| option is not always defined
	11 : Apr 27, 2006 * VimballList would create missing subdirectories that
			    the vimball specified were needed.  Fixed.
	10 : Apr 27, 2006 * moved all setting saving/restoration to a pair of
			    functions.  Included some more settings in them
			    which frequently cause trouble.
	9  : Apr 26, 2006 * various changes to support Windows predilection
			    for backslashes and spaces in file and directory
			    names.
	7  : Apr 25, 2006 * bypasses foldenable
			  * uses more exe and less norm! (:yank :put etc)
			  * does better at insuring a "Press ENTER" prompt
			    appears to keep its messages visible
	4  : Mar 31, 2006 * BufReadPost seems to fire twice; BufReadEnter
			    only fires once, so the "Source this file..."
			    message is now issued only once.
	3  : Mar 20, 2006 * removed query, now requires sourcing to be
			    extracted (:so %).  Message to that effect
			    included.
			  * :VimballList  now shows files that would be
			    extracted.
	2  : Mar 20, 2006 * query, :UseVimball included
	1  : Mar 20, 2006 * initial release
