Introduction					*hangul*
------------
It is to input hangul, the Korean language, with VIM GUI version.
If you have a XIM program, you can use another |+xim| feature.
Basically, it is for anybody who has no XIM program.

Compile
-------
Next is a basic option.  You can add any other configure option. >

   ./configure --with-x --enable-multibyte --enable-hangulinput \
            --disable-xim

And you should check feature.h.  If |+hangul_input| feature is enabled
by configure, you can select more options such as keyboard type, 2 bulsik
or 3 bulsik.  You can find keywords like next in there. >

	#define HANGUL_DEFAULT_KEYBOARD 2
	#define ESC_CHG_TO_ENG_MODE
	/* #define X_LOCALE */

Environment variables
---------------------
You should set LANG variable to Korean locale such as ko, ko_KR.eucKR
or ko_KR.UTF-8.
If you set LC_ALL variable, it should be set to Korean locale also.

VIM resource
------------
You may want to set 'encoding' and 'fileencodings'.
Next are examples: >

	:set encoding=euc-kr
	:set encoding=utf-8
	:set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,cp949,euc-kr,latin1

Keyboard
--------
You can change keyboard type (2 bulsik or 3 bulsik) using VIM_KEYBOARD
or HANGUL_KEYBOARD_TYPE environment variables.  For sh, just do (2 bulsik): >

    export VIM_KEYBOARD="2"
or >
    export HANGUL_KEYBOARD_TYPE="2"

If both are set, VIM_KEYBOARD has higher priority.

Hangul Fonts
------------
If you use GTK version of GVIM, you should set 'guifont' and 'guifontwide'.
For example: >
    set guifont=Courier\ 12
    set guifontwide=NanumGothicCoding\ 12

If you use Motif or Athena version of GVIM, you should set 'guifontset' in
your vimrc.  You can set fontset in the .Xdefaults file.

$HOME/.gvimrc: >
    set guifontset=english_font,hangul_font

$HOME/.Xdefaults: >
    Vim.font: english_font

    ! Nexts are for hangul menu with Athena
    *international: True
    Vim*fontSet: english_font,hangul_font

    ! Nexts are for hangul menu with Motif
    *international: True
    Vim*fontList: english_font;hangul_font:

attention! the , (comma) or ; (semicolon)

And there should be no ':set guifont'.  If it exists, then Gvim ignores
':set guifontset'.  It means VIM runs without fontset supporting.
So, you can see only English.  Hangul does not be correctly displayed.

After "fontset" feature is enabled, VIM does not allow using english
font only in "font" setting for syntax.
For example, if you use >
   :set guifontset=eng_font,your_font
in your .gvimrc, then you should do for syntax >
   :hi Comment guifg=Cyan font=another_eng_font,another_your_font
If you just do >
   :hi Comment font=another_eng_font
then you can see a error message.  Be careful!

hangul_font width should be twice than english_font width.

Unsupported Feature
-------------------
We don't support Johab font.
We don't support Hanja input.
And We don't have any plan to support them.

If you really need such features, you can use console version of VIM with a
capable terminal emulator.
