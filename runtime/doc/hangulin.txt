						*hangul*
Vim had built-in support for hangul, the Korean language, for users without
XIM (X Input Method).  Since it didn't work well and was not maintained it was
removed in Vim 8.1.2327.

If you want this hangul input method you can go back to Vim 8.1.2326 or
earlier.  If you think this code is still useful and want to maintain it, make
a patch to add it back.  However, making it work with UTF-8 encoding would be
best.
