==============================================================================
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES				*incompatible-8*

These changes are incompatible with previous releases.  Check this list if you
run into a problem when upgrading from Vim 7.4 to 8.0.

The support for MS-DOS has been removed.  It hasn't been working for a while
and removing it cleans up the code quite a bit.

The support for Windows 16 bit (Windows 95 and older) has been removed.

Minor incompatibilities:

For filetype detection: ...

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES						*new-8*

First a list of the bigger new features.  A comprehensive list is below.


Asynchronous I/O support, channels ~

Vim can now exchange messages with another process in the background.  The
messages are received and handled while Vim is waiting for a character.  See
|channel-demo| for an example, communicating with a Python server.

Closely related to channels is JSON support.  JSON is widely supported and can
easily be used for inter-process communication, allowing for writing a server
in any language.  The functions to use are |json_encode()| and |json_decode()|.


Jobs ~

Vim can now start a job, communicate with it and stop it.  This is very useful
to run a process for completion, syntax checking, etc.  Channels are used to
communicate with the job.  Jobs can also read from or write to a buffer or a
file.  See |job_start()|.


Timers ~

Also asynchronous are timers.  They can fire once or repeatedly and invoke a
function to do any work.  For example: >
	let tempTimer = timer_start(4000, 'CheckTemp')
This will make a call four seconds (4000 milli seconds) later, like: >
	call CheckTemp()


Partials ~

Vim already had a Funcref, a reference to a function.  A partial also refers
to a function, and additionally binds arguments and/or a dictionary.  This is
especially useful for callbacks on channels and timers.  E.g., for the timer
example above, to pass an argument to the function: >
	let tempTimer = timer_start(4000, function('CheckTemp', ['out']))
This will a make call four seconds later, like: >
	call CheckTemp('out')


Packages ~

Plugins keep growing and more of them are available than ever before.  To keep
the collection of plugins manageable package support has been added.  This is
a convenient way to get one or more plugins, drop them in a directory and
possibly keep them updated.  Vim will load them automatically, or only when
desired.  See |packages|.


New style tests ~

This is for Vim developers.  So far writing tests for Vim has not been easy.
Vim 8 adds assert functions and a framework to run tests.  This makes it a lot
simpler to write tests and keep them updated.

These functions have been added:
	|assert_equal()|
	|assert_notequal()|
	|assert_exception()|
	|assert_fails()|
	|assert_false()|
	|assert_match()|
	|assert_notmatch()|
	|assert_true()|
	|alloc_fail()|
	|disable_char_avail_for_testing()|


Window IDs ~

Previously windows could only be accessed by their number. And every time a
window would open, close or move that number changes.  Each window now has a
unique ID, so that they are easy to find.


Wrapping lines with indent ~

The 'breakindent' option has been added to be able to wrap lines without
changing the amount of indent.


Windows: Direct-X support ~

This adds the 'renderoptions' option to allow for switching on Direct-X
(DirectWrite) support on MS-Windows.


GTK+ 3 support ~

GTK+ 2 is getting old, GTK+ 3 is here.  Support has been added and it already
works quite well, mostly just like GTK+ 2.


Vim script enhancements					*new-vim-script-8*
-----------------------

In Vim script the following types have been added:

	|Special|	|v:false|, |v:true|, |v:none| and |v:null|
	|Channel|	connection to another process for asynchronous I/O
	|Job|		process control

Many functions and commands have been added to support the new types.



Various new items					*new-items-8*
-----------------

Normal mode commands: ~


Insert mode commands: ~


Options: ~


Ex commands: ~


Ex command modifiers: ~


Ex command arguments: ~


New and extended functions: ~



New Vim variables: ~

|v:vim_did_enter|	Set when VimEnter autocommands are triggered


New autocommand events: ~



New highlight groups: ~


New items in search patterns: ~


New Syntax/Indent/FTplugin files: ~


New Keymaps: ~


New message translations: ~


Others: ~


==============================================================================
IMPROVEMENTS						*improvements-8*

The existing blowfish encryption turned out to be much weaker than it was
supposed to be.  The blowfish2 method has been added to fix that.  Note that
this still isn't a state-of-the-art encryption, but good enough for most
usage.  See 'cryptmethod'.

==============================================================================
COMPILE TIME CHANGES					*compile-changes-8*

Dropped the support for MS-DOS.  It was too big to fit in memory.


==============================================================================
PATCHES						*patches-8* *bug-fixes-8*

The list of patches that got included since 7.4.0.  This includes all the new
features, but does not include runtime file changes (syntax, indent, help,
etc.)
