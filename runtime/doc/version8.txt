==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES						*new-8*

First an overview of the more interesting new features.  A comprehensive list
is below.


Asynchronous I/O support, channels ~

Vim can now exchange messages with other processes in the background.  This
makes it possible to have servers do work and send back the results to Vim.
See |channel-demo| for an example, this shows communicating with a Python
server.

Closely related to channels is JSON support.  JSON is widely supported and can
easily be used for inter-process communication, allowing for writing a server
in any language.  The functions to use are |json_encode()| and |json_decode()|.

This makes it possible to build very complex plugins, written in any language
and running in a separate process.


Jobs ~

Vim can now start a job, communicate with it and stop it.  This is very useful
to run a process for completion, syntax checking, etc.  Channels are used to
communicate with the job.  Jobs can also read from or write to a buffer or a
file.  See |job_start()|.


Timers ~

Also asynchronous are timers.  They can fire once or repeatedly and invoke a
function to do any work.  For example: >
	let tempTimer = timer_start(4000, 'CheckTemp')
This will call the CheckTemp() function four seconds (4000 milli seconds)
later.  See |timer_start()|.


Partials ~

Vim already had a Funcref, a reference to a function.  A partial also refers
to a function, and additionally binds arguments and/or a dictionary.  This is
especially useful for callbacks on channels and timers.  E.g., for the timer
example above, to pass an argument to the function: >
	let tempTimer = timer_start(4000, function('CheckTemp', ['out']))
This will call CheckTemp('out') four seconds later.


Lambda and Closure ~

A short way to create a function has been added: {args -> expr}.  See |lambda|.
This is useful for functions such as `filter()` and `map()`, which now also
accept a function argument.  Example: >
	:call filter(mylist, {idx, val -> val > 20})

A lambda can use variables defined in the scope where the lambda is defined.
This is usually called a |closure|.

User defined functions can also be a closure by adding the "closure" argument
|:func-closure|.


Packages ~

Plugins keep growing and more of them are available than ever before.  To keep
the collection of plugins manageable package support has been added.  This is
a convenient way to get one or more plugins, drop them in a directory and
possibly keep them updated.  Vim will load them automatically, or only when
desired.  See |packages|.


New style tests ~

This is for Vim developers.  So far writing tests for Vim has not been easy.
Vim 8 adds assert functions and a framework to run tests.  This makes it a lot
simpler to write tests and keep them updated.  Also new are several functions
that are added specifically for testing. See |test-functions|.


Window IDs ~

Previously windows could only be accessed by their number. And every time a
window would open, close or move that number changes.  Each window now has a
unique ID, so that they are easy to find.  See |win_getid()| and |win_id2win()|.


Viminfo uses timestamps ~

Previously the information stored in viminfo was whatever the last Vim wrote
there.  Now timestamps are used to always keep the most recent items.
See |viminfo-timestamp|.


Wrapping lines with indent ~

The 'breakindent' option has been added to be able to wrap lines without
changing the amount of indent.


Windows: DirectX support ~

This adds the 'renderoptions' option to allow for switching on DirectX
(DirectWrite) support on MS-Windows.


GTK+ 3 support ~

The GTK+ 3 GUI works just like GTK+ 2 except for hardly noticeable technical
differences between them.  Configure still chooses GTK+ 2 if both 2 and 3 are
available.  See src/Makefile for how to use GTK+ 3 instead.  See
|gui-x11-compiling| for other details.


Vim script enhancements					*new-vim-script-8*
-----------------------

In Vim script the following types have been added:

	|Special|	|v:false|, |v:true|, |v:none| and |v:null|
	|Channel|	connection to another process for asynchronous I/O
	|Job|		process control

Many functions and commands have been added to support the new types.

On some systems the numbers used in Vim script are now 64 bit.  This can be
checked with the |+num64| feature.

Many items were added to support |new-style-testing|.

printf() now accepts any type of argument for %s.  It is converted to a string
like with string().

==============================================================================
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES				*incompatible-8*

These changes are incompatible with previous releases.  Check this list if you
run into a problem when upgrading from Vim 7.4 to 8.0.


Better defaults without a vimrc ~

When no vimrc file is found, the |defaults.vim| script is loaded to set more
useful default values for new users.  That includes setting 'nocompatible'.
Thus Vim no longer starts up in Vi compatible mode.  If you do want that,
either create a .vimrc file that does "set compatible" or start Vim with
"vim -C".


Support removed ~

The support for MS-DOS has been removed.  It hasn't been working for a while
(Vim doesn't fit in memory) and removing it cleans up the code quite a bit.

The support for Windows 16 bit (Windows 95 and older) has been removed.

The support for OS/2 has been removed.  It probably hasn't been working for a
while since nobody uses it.

The SNiFF+ support has been removed.


Minor incompatibilities: ~

Probably...

==============================================================================
IMPROVEMENTS						*improvements-8*

The existing blowfish encryption turned out to be much weaker than it was
supposed to be.  The blowfish2 method has been added to fix that.  Note that
this still isn't a state-of-the-art encryption, but good enough for most
usage.  See 'cryptmethod'.


==============================================================================
COMPILE TIME CHANGES					*compile-changes-8*

The Vim repository was moved from Google code to github, since Google code
was shut down.  It can now be found at https://github.com/vim/vim.

Functions now use ANSI-C declarations.  At least a C-89 compatible compiler is
required.

The +visual feature is now always included.

==============================================================================

Files:      src/channel.c, src/eval.c, src/structs.h

Patch 7.4.1423
Problem:    Channel test fails on MS-Windows.

Files:      src/gui_w32.c

Patch 7.4.1430
Problem:    When encoding JSON, turning NaN and Infinity into null without
            giving an error is not useful.

            a long time.
Solution:   Add BLN_NOOPT.  Don't call buf_valid() in buf_copy_options().
            Remember the last file name used.  When going through the buffer

Solution:   Make it a bit better by flushing GUI output.  Don't redraw the
            cursor after updating the screen if the blink state is off.
Files:      src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/screen.c

Patch 7.4.2026

==============================================================================
VERSION 8.1				*version-8.1* *version8.1* *vim-8.1*

This section is about improvements made between version 8.0 and 8.1.

This release has hundreds of bug fixes, there is a new feature and there are
many minor improvements.


The terminal window				*new-terminal-window*
-------------------

You can now open a window which functions as a terminal.  You can use it for:
- Running a command, such as "make", while editing in other windows
- Running a shell and execute several commands
- Use the terminal debugger plugin, see |terminal-debugger|

All of this is especially useful when running Vim on a remote (ssh)
connection, when you can't easily open more terminals.

For more information see |terminal-window|.


Changed							*changed-8.1*
-------

Internal: A few C99 features are now allowed such as // comments and a
comma after the last enum entry.  See |style-compiler|.

Since patch 8.0.0029 removed support for older MS-Windows systems, only
MS-Windows XP and later are supported.


Added							*added-8.1*
-----

Various syntax, indent and other plugins were added.

Quickfix improvements (by Yegappan Lakshmanan):
	Added support for modifying any quickfix/location list in the quickfix
	stack.
	Added a unique identifier for every quickfix/location list.
	Added support for associating any Vim type as a context information to
	a quickfix/location list.
	Enhanced the getqflist(), getloclist(), setqflist() and setloclist()
	functions to get and set the various quickfix/location list attributes.
	Added the QuickFixLine highlight group to highlight the current line
	in the quickfix window.
	The quickfix buffer b:changedtick variable is incremented for every
	change to the contained quickfix list.
	Added a changedtick variable to a quickfix/location list which is
	incremented when the list is modified.
	Added support for parsing text using 'errorformat' without creating a
	new quickfix list.
	Added support for the "module" item to a quickfix entry which can be
	used for display purposes instead of a long file name.
	Added support for freeing all the lists in the quickfix/location stack.
	When opening a quickfix window using the :copen/:cwindow commands, the
	supplied split modifiers are used.

Functions:
	All the term_ functions.
