			      Write a Vim script


The Vim script language is used for the startup vimrc file, syntax files, and
many other things.  This chapter explains the items that can be used in a Vim
script.  There are a lot of them, therefore this is a long chapter.

==============================================================================
*41.1*	Introduction				*vim-script-intro* *script*

Let's start with some nomenclature. A Vim script is any file that Vim can
interpret and execute.  This includes files written in Vim's scripting
language like for example .vim files or configuration files like .vimrc and
.gvimrc.  These scripts may define functions, commands and settings that Vim
uses to customize and extend its behavior.

						*vim-script-notation*
The correct notation is "Vim script" (or "Vim9 script" when refering to the
new Vim9 language |Vim9-script|), so we will use "Vim script" to refer to the
Vim scripting language throughout this documentation. This shorthand helps to
streamline explanations and discussions about scripting with Vim.

A Vim plugin is a collection of one or more Vim scripts, along with additional
files like help documentation, configuration files, and other resources,
designed to add specific features or functionalities to Vim. A plugin can
provide new commands, enhance existing capabilities, and integrate external
tools or services into the Vim environment.

Your first experience with Vim scripts is the vimrc file.  Vim reads it when
it starts up and executes the commands.  You can set options to the values you
prefer, define mappings, select plugins and much more.   You can use any colon
command in it (commands that start with a ":"; these are sometimes referred to
as Ex commands or command-line commands).

Syntax files are also Vim scripts.  As are files that set options for a
specific file type.  A complicated macro can be defined by a separate Vim
script file.  You can think of other uses yourself.

Vim script comes in two flavors: legacy and |Vim9|.  Since this help file is
for new users, we'll teach you the newer and more convenient |Vim9| syntax.
While legacy script is particularly for Vim, |Vim9| script looks more like
other languages, such as JavaScript and TypeScript.

To try out Vim script the best way is to edit a script file and source it.
Basically: >
	:edit test.vim
	[insert the script lines you want]
	:w
	:source %

Let's start with a simple example: >

	vim9script
	var i = 1
	while i < 5
	  echo "count is" i
	  i += 1
	endwhile
<
The output of the example code is:

	count is 1 ~
	count is 2 ~
	count is 3 ~
	count is 4 ~

In the first line the `vim9script` command makes clear this is a new, |Vim9|
script file.  That matters for how the rest of the file is used.  It is
recommended to put it in the very first line, before any comments.
							*vim9-declarations*
The `var i = 1` command declares the "i" variable and initializes it.  The
generic form is: >

	var {name} = {expression}

In this case the variable name is "i" and the expression is a simple value,
the number one.

The `while` command starts a loop.  The generic form is: >

	while {condition}
	  {statements}
	endwhile

The statements until the matching `endwhile` are executed for as long as the
condition is true.  The condition used here is the expression "i < 5".  This
is true when the variable i is smaller than five.
	Note:
	If you happen to write a while loop that keeps on running, you can
	interrupt it by pressing CTRL-C (CTRL-Break on MS-Windows).

The `echo` command prints its arguments.  In this case the string "count is"
and the value of the variable i.  Since i is one, this will print:

	count is 1 ~

Then there is the `i += 1` command.  This does the same thing as "i = i + 1",
it adds one to the variable i and assigns the new value to the same variable.

The example was given to explain the commands, but would you really want to
make such a loop, it can be written much more compact: >

	for i in range(1, 4)
	  echo $"count is {i}"
	endfor

We won't explain how `for`, `range()` and `$"string"` work until later.
Follow the links if you are impatient.


TRYING OUT EXAMPLES

You can easily try out most examples in these help files without saving the
commands to a file.  For example, to try out the "for" loop above do this:
1. position the cursor on the "for"
2. start Visual mode with "v"
3. move down to the "endfor"
4. press colon, then "so" and Enter

After pressing colon you will see ":'<,'>", which is the range of the Visually
selected text.

For some commands it matters they are executed as in |Vim9| script.  But typed
commands normally use legacy script syntax, such as the example below that
causes the E1004 error.  For that use this fourth step:
4. press colon, then "vim9 so" and Enter

"vim9" is short for `vim9cmd`, which is a command modifier to execute the
following command in |Vim9| syntax.

Note that this won't work for examples that require a script context.


FOUR KINDS OF NUMBERS

Numbers can be decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary.

A hexadecimal number starts with "0x" or "0X".  For example "0x1f" is decimal
31 and "0x1234" is decimal 4660.

An octal number starts with "0o", "0O".  "0o17" is decimal 15.

A binary number starts with "0b" or "0B".  For example "0b101" is decimal 5.

A decimal number is just digits.  Careful: In legacy script don't put a zero
before a decimal number, it will be interpreted as an octal number!  That's
one reason to use |Vim9| script.

The `echo` command evaluates its argument and when it is a number always
prints the decimal form.  Example: >

	echo 0x7f 0o36
<	127 30 ~

A number is made negative with a minus sign.  This also works for hexadecimal,
octal and binary numbers: >

	echo -0x7f
<	-127 ~

A minus sign is also used for subtraction.  This can sometimes lead to
confusion.  If we put a minus sign before both numbers we get an error: >

	echo -0x7f -0o36
<	E1004: White space required before and after '-' at "-0o36" ~

Note: if you are not using a |Vim9| script to try out these commands but type
them directly, they will be executed as legacy script.  Then the echo command
sees the second minus sign as subtraction.  To get the error, prefix the
command with `vim9cmd`: >

	vim9cmd echo -0x7f -0o36
<	E1004: White space required before and after '-' at "-0o36" ~

White space in an expression is often required to make sure it is easy to read
and avoid errors.  Such as thinking that the "-0o36" above makes the number
negative, while it is actually seen as a subtraction.

To actually have the minus sign be used for negation, you can put the second
expression in parentheses: >

	echo -0x7f (-0o36)
<	-127 -30 ~

==============================================================================
*41.2*	Variables

A variable name consists of ASCII letters, digits and the underscore.  It
cannot start with a digit.  Valid variable names are:

	counter
	_aap3
	very_long_variable_name_with_underscores
	CamelCaseName
	LENGTH

Invalid names are "foo.bar" and "6var".

Some variables are global.  To see a list of currently defined global
variables type this command: >

	:let

You can use global variables everywhere.  However, it is too easy to use the
same name in two unrelated scripts.  Therefore variables declared in a script
are local to that script.  For example, if you have this in "script1.vim": >

	vim9script
	var counter = 5
	echo counter
<	5 ~

And you try to use the variable in "script2.vim": >

	vim9script
	echo counter
<	E121: Undefined variable: counter ~

Using a script-local variable means you can be sure that it is only changed in
that script and not elsewhere.

If you do want to share variables between scripts, use the "g:" prefix and
assign the value directly, do not use `var`.  And use a specific name to avoid
mistakes.  Thus in "script1.vim": >

	vim9script
	g:mash_counter = 5
	echo g:mash_counter
<	5 ~

And then in "script2.vim": >

	vim9script
	echo g:mash_counter
<	5 ~

Global variables can also be accessed on the command line, E.g. typing this: >
	echo g:mash_counter
That will not work for a script-local variable.

More about script-local variables here: |script-variable|.

There are more kinds of variables, see |internal-variables|.  The most often
used ones are:

	b:name		variable local to a buffer
	w:name		variable local to a window
	g:name		global variable (also in a function)
	v:name		variable predefined by Vim


DELETING VARIABLES

Variables take up memory and show up in the output of the `let` command.  To
delete a global variable use the `unlet` command.  Example: >

	unlet g:counter

This deletes the global variable "g:counter" to free up the memory it uses.
If you are not sure if the variable exists, and don't want an error message
when it doesn't, append !: >

	unlet! g:counter

You cannot `unlet` script-local variables in |Vim9| script, only in legacy
script.

When a script has been processed to the end, the local variables declared
there will not be deleted.  Functions defined in the script can use them.
Example:
>
	vim9script
	var counter = 0
	def g:GetCount(): number
	  counter += 1
	  return counter
	enddef

Every time you call the function it will return the next count: >
	:echo g:GetCount()
<	1 ~
>
	:echo g:GetCount()
<	2 ~

If you are worried a script-local variable is consuming too much memory, set
it to an empty or null value after you no longer need it.  Example: >
	var lines = readfile(...)
	...
	lines = []

Note: below we'll leave out the `vim9script` line from examples, so we can
concentrate on the relevant commands, but you'll still need to put it at the
top of your script file.


STRING VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS

So far only numbers were used for the variable value.  Strings can be used as
well.  Numbers and strings are the basic types of variables that Vim supports.
Example: >

	var name = "Peter"
	echo name
<	Peter ~

Every variable has a type.  Very often, as in this example, the type is
defined by assigning a value.  This is called type inference.  If you do not
want to give the variable a value yet, you need to specify the type: >

	var name: string
	var age: number
	if male
	   name = "Peter"
	   age = 42
	else
	   name = "Elisa"
	   age = 45
	endif

If you make a mistake and try to assign the wrong type of value you'll get an
error: >

	age = "Peter"
<	E1012: Type mismatch; expected number but got string ~

More about types in |41.8|.

To assign a string value to a variable, you can use a string constant.  There
are two types of these.  First the string in double quotes, as we used
already.  If you want to include a double quote inside the string, put a
backslash in front of it: >

	var name = "he is \"Peter\""
	echo name
<	he is "Peter" ~

To avoid the need for backslashes, you can use a string in single quotes: >

	var name = 'he is "Peter"'
	echo name
<	he is "Peter" ~

Inside a single-quote string all the characters are as they are.  Only the
single quote itself is special: you need to use two to get one.  A backslash
is taken literally, thus you can't use it to change the meaning of the
character after it: >

	var name = 'P\e''ter'''
	echo name
<	P\e'ter' ~

In double-quote strings it is possible to use special characters.  Here are a
few useful ones:

	\t		<Tab>
	\n		<NL>, line break
	\r		<CR>, <Enter>
	\e		<Esc>
	\b		<BS>, backspace
	\"		"
	\\		\, backslash
	\<Esc>		<Esc>
	\<C-W>		CTRL-W

The last two are just examples.  The  "\<name>" form can be used to include
the special key "name".

See |expr-quote| for the full list of special items in a string.

==============================================================================
*41.3*	Expressions

Vim has a fairly standard way to handle expressions.  You can read the
definition here: |expression-syntax|.  Here we will show the most common
items.

The numbers, strings and variables mentioned above are expressions by
themselves.  Thus everywhere an expression is expected, you can use a number,
string or variable.  Other basic items in an expression are:

	$NAME		environment variable
	&name		option value
	@r		register contents

Examples: >

	echo "The value of 'tabstop' is" &ts
	echo "Your home directory is" $HOME
	if @a == 'text'

The &name form can also be used to set an option value, do something and
restore the old value.  Example: >

	var save_ic = &ic
	set noic
	s/The Start/The Beginning/
	&ic = save_ic

This makes sure the "The Start" pattern is used with the 'ignorecase' option
off.  Still, it keeps the value that the user had set.  (Another way to do
this would be to add "\C" to the pattern, see |/\C|.)


MATHEMATICS

It becomes more interesting if we combine these basic items.  Let's start with
mathematics on numbers:

	a + b		add
	a - b		subtract
	a * b		multiply
	a / b		divide
	a % b		modulo

The usual precedence is used.  Example: >

	echo 10 + 5 * 2
<	20 ~

Grouping is done with parentheses.  No surprises here.  Example: >

	echo (10 + 5) * 2
<	30 ~


OTHERS

Strings can be concatenated with ".." (see |expr6|).  Example: >

	echo "Name: " .. name
	Name: Peter

When the "echo" command gets multiple arguments, it separates them with a
space.  In the example the argument is a single expression, thus no space is
inserted.

If you don't like the concatenation you can use the $"string" form, which
accepts an expression in curly braces: >
	echo $"Name: {name}"

See |interpolated-string| for more information.

Borrowed from the C language is the conditional expression: >

	a ? b : c

If "a" evaluates to true "b" is used, otherwise "c" is used.  Example: >

	var nr = 4
	echo nr > 5 ? "nr is big" : "nr is small"
<	nr is small ~

The three parts of the constructs are always evaluated first, thus you could
see it works as: >

	(a) ? (b) : (c)

There is also the falsy operator: >
	echo name ?? "No name given"
See |??|.

==============================================================================
*41.4*	Conditionals

The `if` commands executes the following statements, until the matching
`endif`, only when a condition is met.  The generic form is:

	if {condition}
	   {statements}
	endif

Only when the expression {condition} evaluates to true or one will the
{statements} be executed.  If they are not executed they must still be valid
commands.  If they contain garbage, Vim won't be able to find the matching
`endif`.

You can also use `else`.  The generic form for this is:

	if {condition}
	   {statements}
	else
	   {statements}
	endif

The second {statements} block is only executed if the first one isn't.

Finally, there is `elseif`

	if {condition}
	   {statements}
	elseif {condition}
	   {statements}
	endif

This works just like using `else` and then `if`, but without the need for an
extra `endif`.

A useful example for your vimrc file is checking the 'term' option and doing
something depending upon its value: >

	if &term == "xterm"
	  # Do stuff for xterm
	elseif &term == "vt100"
	  # Do stuff for a vt100 terminal
	else
	  # Do something for other terminals
	endif

This uses "#" to start a comment, more about that later.


LOGIC OPERATIONS

We already used some of them in the examples.  These are the most often used
ones:

	a == b		equal to
	a != b		not equal to
	a >  b		greater than
	a >= b		greater than or equal to
	a <  b		less than
	a <= b		less than or equal to

The result is true if the condition is met and false otherwise.  An example: >

	if v:version >= 800
	  echo "congratulations"
	else
	  echo "you are using an old version, upgrade!"
	endif

Here "v:version" is a variable defined by Vim, which has the value of the Vim
version.  800 is for version 8.0, version 8.1 has the value 801.  This is
useful to write a script that works with multiple versions of Vim.
See |v:version|.  You can also check for a specific feature with `has()` or a
specific patch, see |has-patch|.

The logic operators work both for numbers and strings.  When comparing two
strings, the mathematical difference is used.  This compares byte values,
which may not be right for some languages.

If you try to compare a string with a number you will get an error.

For strings there are two more useful items:

	str =~ pat		matches with
	str !~ pat		does not match with

The left item "str" is used as a string.  The right item "pat" is used as a
pattern, like what's used for searching.  Example: >

	if str =~ " "
	  echo "str contains a space"
	endif
	if str !~ '\.$'
	  echo "str does not end in a full stop"
	endif

Notice the use of a single-quote string for the pattern.  This is useful,
because patterns tend to contain many backslashes and backslashes need to be
doubled in a double-quote string.

The match is not anchored, if you want to match the whole string start with
"^" and end with "$".

The 'ignorecase' option is not used when comparing strings.  When you do want
to ignore case append "?".  Thus "==?" compares two strings to be equal while
ignoring case.  For the full table see |expr-==|.


MORE LOOPING

The `while` command was already mentioned.  Two more statements can be used in
between the `while` and the `endwhile`:

	continue		Jump back to the start of the while loop; the
				loop continues.
	break			Jump forward to the `endwhile`; the loop is
				discontinued.

Example: >

	var counter = 1
	while counter < 40
	  if skip_number(counter)
	    continue
	  endif
	  if last_number(counter)
	    break
	  endif
	  sleep 50m
	  ++counter
	endwhile

The `sleep` command makes Vim take a nap.  The "50m" specifies fifty
milliseconds.  Another example is `sleep 4`, which sleeps for four seconds.

`continue` and `break` can also be used in between `for` and `endfor`.
Even more looping can be done with the `for` command, see below in |41.8|.

==============================================================================
*41.5*	Executing an expression

So far the commands in the script were executed by Vim directly.  The
`execute` command allows executing the result of an expression.  This is a
very powerful way to build commands and execute them.

An example is to jump to a tag, which is contained in a variable: >

	execute "tag " .. tag_name

The ".." is used to concatenate the string "tag " with the value of variable
"tag_name".  Suppose "tag_name" has the value "get_cmd", then the command that
will be executed is: >

	tag get_cmd

The `execute` command can only execute Ex commands.  The `normal` command
executes Normal mode commands.  However, its argument is not an expression but
the literal command characters.  Example: >

	normal gg=G

This jumps to the first line with "gg" and formats all lines with the "="
operator and the "G" movement.

To make `normal` work with an expression, combine `execute` with it.
Example: >

	execute "normal " .. count .. "j"

This will move the cursor "count" lines down.

Make sure that the argument for `normal` is a complete command.  Otherwise
Vim will run into the end of the argument and silently abort the command.  For
example, if you start the delete operator, you must give the movement command
also.  This works: >

	normal d$

This does nothing: >

	normal d

If you start Insert mode and do not end it with Esc, it will end anyway.  This
works to insert "new text": >

	execute "normal inew text"

If you want to do something after inserting text you do need to end Insert
mode: >

	execute "normal inew text\<Esc>b"

This inserts "new text" and puts the cursor on the first letter of "text".
Notice the use of the special key "\<Esc>".  This avoids having to enter a
real <Esc> character in your script.  That is where `execute` with a
double-quote string comes in handy.

If you don't want to execute a string as a command but evaluate it to get the
result of the expression, you can use the eval() function: >

	var optname = "path"
	var optvalue = eval('&' .. optname)

A "&" character is prepended to "path", thus the argument to eval() is
"&path".  The result will then be the value of the 'path' option.

==============================================================================
*41.6*	Using functions

Vim defines many functions and provides a large amount of functionality that
way.  A few examples will be given in this section.  You can find the whole
list below: |function-list|.

A function is called with the parameters in between parentheses, separated by
commas.  Example: >

	search("Date: ", "W")

This calls the search() function, with arguments "Date: " and "W".  The
search() function uses its first argument as a search pattern and the second
one as flags.  The "W" flag means the search doesn't wrap around the end of
the file.

Using the `call` command is optional in |Vim9| script.  It is required in
legacy script and on the command line: >

	call search("Date: ", "W")

A function can be called in an expression.  Example: >

	var line = getline(".")
	var repl = substitute(line, '\a', "*", "g")
	setline(".", repl)

The getline() function obtains a line from the current buffer.  Its argument
is a specification of the line number.  In this case "." is used, which means
the line where the cursor is.

The substitute() function does something similar to the `:substitute` command.
The first argument "line" is the string on which to perform the substitution.
The second argument '\a' is the pattern, the third "*" is the replacement
string.  Finally, the last argument "g" is the flags.

The setline() function sets the line, specified by the first argument, to a
new string, the second argument.  In this example the line under the cursor is
replaced with the result of the substitute().  Thus the effect of the three
statements is equal to: >

	:substitute/\a/*/g

Using the functions becomes interesting when you do more work before and
after the substitute() call.

==============================================================================
*41.7*	Defining a function

Vim enables you to define your own functions.  The basic function declaration
begins as follows: >

	def {name}({var1}, {var2}, ...): return-type
	  {body}
	enddef
<
	Note:
	Function names must begin with a capital letter.

Let's define a short function to return the smaller of two numbers.  It starts
with this line: >

	def Min(num1: number, num2: number): number

This tells Vim that the function is named "Min", it takes two arguments that
are numbers: "num1" and "num2" and returns a number.

The first thing you need to do is to check to see which number is smaller:
   >
	if num1 < num2

Let's assign the variable "smaller" the value of the smallest number: >

	var smaller: number
	if num1 < num2
	  smaller = num1
	else
	  smaller = num2
	endif

The variable "smaller" is a local variable.  It is declared to be a number,
that way Vim can warn you for any mistakes.  Variables used inside a function
are local unless prefixed by something like "g:", "w:", or "b:".

	Note:
	To access a global variable from inside a function you must prepend
	"g:" to it.  Thus "g:today" inside a function is used for the global
	variable "today", and "today" is another variable, local to the
	function or the script.

You now use the `return` statement to return the smallest number to the user.
Finally, you end the function: >

	  return smaller
	enddef

The complete function definition is as follows: >

	def Min(num1: number, num2: number): number
	  var smaller: number
	  if num1 < num2
	    smaller = num1
	  else
	    smaller = num2
	  endif
	  return smaller
	enddef

Obviously this is a verbose example.  You can make it shorter by using two
return commands: >

	def Min(num1: number, num2: number): number
	  if num1 < num2
	    return num1
	  endif
	  return num2
	enddef

And if you remember the conditional expression, you need only one line: >

	def Min(num1: number, num2: number): number
	  return num1 < num2 ? num1 : num2
	enddef

A user defined function is called in exactly the same way as a built-in
function.  Only the name is different.  The Min function can be used like
this: >

	echo Min(5, 8)

Only now will the function be executed and the lines be parsed by Vim.
If there are mistakes, like using an undefined variable or function, you will
now get an error message.  When defining the function these errors are not
detected.  To get the errors sooner you can tell Vim to compile all the
functions in the script: >

	defcompile

Compiling functions takes a little time, but does report errors early.  You
could use `:defcompile` at the end of your script while working on it, and
comment it out when everything is fine.

For a function that does not return anything simply leave out the return type: >

	def SayIt(text: string)
	  echo text
	enddef

If you want to return any kind of value, you can use the "any" return type: >
	def GetValue(): any
This disables type checking for the return value, use only when needed.

It is also possible to define a legacy function with `function` and
`endfunction`.  These do not have types and are not compiled.  Therefore they
execute much slower.


USING A RANGE

A line range can be used with a function call.  The function will be called
once for every line in the range, with the cursor in that line.  Example: >

	def Number()
	  echo "line " .. line(".") .. " contains: " .. getline(".")
	enddef

If you call this function with: >

	:10,15call Number()

The function will be called six times, starting on line 10 and ending on line
15.


LISTING FUNCTIONS

The `function` command lists the names and arguments of all user-defined
functions: >

	:function
<	def <SNR>86_Show(start: string, ...items: list<string>) ~
	function GetVimIndent() ~
	function SetSyn(name) ~

The "<SNR>" prefix means that a function is script-local.  |Vim9| functions
will start with "def" and include argument and return types.  Legacy functions
are listed with "function".

To see what a function does, use its name as an argument for `function`: >

	:function SetSyn
<	1     if &syntax == '' ~
	2       let &syntax = a:name ~
	3     endif ~
	   endfunction ~

To see the "Show" function you need to include the script prefix, since
multiple "Show" functions can be defined in different scripts.  To find
the exact name you can use `function`, but the result may be a very long list.
To only get the functions matching a pattern you can use the `filter` prefix:
>
	:filter Show function
<	def <SNR>86_Show(start: string, ...items: list<string>) ~
>
	:function <SNR>86_Show
<	1    echohl Title ~
	2    echo "start is " .. start ~
	etc.


DEBUGGING

The line number is useful for when you get an error message or when debugging.
See |debug-scripts| about debugging mode.

You can also set the 'verbose' option to 12 or higher to see all function
calls.  Set it to 15 or higher to see every executed line.


DELETING A FUNCTION

To delete the SetSyn() function: >

	:delfunction SetSyn

Deleting only works for global functions and functions in legacy script, not
for functions defined in a |Vim9| script.

You get an error when the function doesn't exist or cannot be deleted.


FUNCTION REFERENCES

Sometimes it can be useful to have a variable point to one function or
another.  You can do it with a function reference variable.  Often shortened
to "funcref".  Example: >

	def Right(): string
	  return 'Right!'
	enddef
	def Wrong(): string
	  return 'Wrong!'
	enddef

	var Afunc = g:result == 1 ? Right : Wrong
	echo Afunc()
<	Wrong! ~

This assumes "g:result" is not one.  See |Funcref| for details.

Note that the name of a variable that holds a function reference must start
with a capital.  Otherwise it could be confused with the name of a builtin
function.

Using a variable number of arguments is introduced in section |50.2|.

==============================================================================
*41.8*	Lists and Dictionaries

So far we have used the basic types String and Number.  Vim also supports
three composite types: List, Tuple and Dictionary.

A List is an ordered sequence of items.  The items can be any kind of value,
thus you can make a List of numbers, a List of Lists and even a List of mixed
items.  To create a List with three strings: >

	var alist = ['aap', 'noot', 'mies']

The List items are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.  To
create an empty List: >

	var alist = []

You can add items to a List with the add() function: >

	var alist = []
	add(alist, 'foo')
	add(alist, 'bar')
	echo alist
<	['foo', 'bar'] ~

List concatenation is done with +: >

	var alist = ['foo', 'bar']
	alist = alist + ['and', 'more']
	echo alist
<	['foo', 'bar', 'and', 'more'] ~

Or, if you want to extend a List with a function, use `extend()`: >

	var alist = ['one']
	extend(alist, ['two', 'three'])
	echo alist
<	['one', 'two', 'three'] ~

Notice that using `add()` will have a different effect than `extend()`: >

	var alist = ['one']
	add(alist, ['two', 'three'])
	echo alist
<	['one', ['two', 'three']] ~

The second argument of add() is added as an item, now you have a nested list.


FOR LOOP

One of the nice things you can do with a List is iterate over it: >

	var alist = ['one', 'two', 'three']
	for n in alist
	  echo n
	endfor
<	one ~
	two ~
	three ~

This will loop over each element in List "alist", assigning each value to
variable "n".  The generic form of a for loop is: >

	for {varname} in {list-expression}
	  {commands}
	endfor

To loop a certain number of times you need a List of a specific length.  The
range() function creates one for you: >

	for a in range(3)
	  echo a
	endfor
<	0 ~
	1 ~
	2 ~

Notice that the first item of the List that range() produces is zero, thus the
last item is one less than the length of the list.  Detail: Internally range()
does not actually create the list, so that a large range used in a for loop
works efficiently.  When used elsewhere, the range is turned into an actual
list, which takes more time for a long list.

You can also specify the maximum value, the stride and even go backwards: >

	for a in range(8, 4, -2)
	  echo a
	endfor
<	8 ~
	6 ~
	4 ~

A more useful example, looping over all the lines in the buffer: >

	for line in getline(1, 50)
	  if line =~ "Date: "
	    echo line
	  endif
	endfor

This looks into lines 1 to 50 (inclusive) and echoes any date found in there.

For further reading see |Lists|.

TUPLE

A Tuple is an immutable ordered sequence of items.  An item can be of any
type.  Items can be accessed by their index number.  To create a Tuple with
three strings: >

	var atuple = ('one', 'two', 'three')

The Tuple items are enclosed in parenthesis and separated by commas.  To
create an empty Tuple: >

	var atuple = ()

The |:for| loop can be used to iterate over the items in a Tuple similar to a
List.

For further reading see |Tuples|.

DICTIONARIES

A Dictionary stores key-value pairs.  You can quickly lookup a value if you
know the key.  A Dictionary is created with curly braces: >

	var uk2nl = {one: 'een', two: 'twee', three: 'drie'}

Now you can lookup words by putting the key in square brackets: >

	echo uk2nl['two']
<	twee ~

If the key does not have special characters, you can use the dot notation: >

	echo uk2nl.two
<	twee ~

The generic form for defining a Dictionary is: >

	{<key> : <value>, ...}

An empty Dictionary is one without any keys: >

	{}

The possibilities with Dictionaries are numerous.  There are various functions
for them as well.  For example, you can obtain a list of the keys and loop
over them: >

	for key in keys(uk2nl)
	  echo key
	endfor
<	three ~
	one ~
	two ~

You will notice the keys are not ordered.  You can sort the list to get a
specific order: >

	for key in sort(keys(uk2nl))
	  echo key
	endfor
<	one ~
	three ~
	two ~

But you can never get back the order in which items are defined.  For that you
need to use a List, it stores items in an ordered sequence.

For further reading see |Dictionaries|.

==============================================================================
*41.9*	White space

Blank lines are allowed in a script and ignored.

Leading whitespace characters (blanks and TABs) are ignored, except when using
|:let-heredoc| without "trim".

Trailing whitespace is often ignored, but not always.  One command that
includes it is `map`.  You have to watch out for that, it can cause hard to
understand mistakes.  A generic solution is to never use trailing white space,
unless you really need it.

To include a whitespace character in the value of an option, it must be
escaped by a "\" (backslash)  as in the following example: >

	:set tags=my\ nice\ file

If it would be written as: >

	:set tags=my nice file

This will issue an error, because it is interpreted as: >

	:set tags=my
	:set nice
	:set file

|Vim9| script is very picky when it comes to white space.  This was done
intentionally to make sure scripts are easy to read and to avoid mistakes.
If you use white space sensibly it will just work.  When not you will get an
error message telling you where white space is missing or should be removed.

==============================================================================
*41.10*	Line continuation

In legacy Vim script line continuation is done by preceding a continuation
line with a backslash: >
	let mylist = [
			\ 'one',
			\ 'two',
			\ ]

This requires the 'cpo' option to exclude the "C" flag.  Normally this is done
by putting this at the start of the script: >
	let s:save_cpo = &cpo
	set cpo&vim

And restore the option at the end of the script: >
	let &cpo = s:save_cpo
	unlet s:save_cpo

A few more details can be found here: |line-continuation|.

In |Vim9| script the backslash can still be used, but in most places it is not
needed: >
	var mylist = [
			'one',
			'two',
			]

Also, the 'cpo' option does not need to be changed.  See
|vim9-line-continuation| for details.

==============================================================================
*41.11*	Comments

In |Vim9| script the character # starts a comment.  That character and
everything after it until the end-of-line is considered a comment and
is ignored, except for commands that don't consider comments, as shown in
examples below.  A comment can start on any character position on the line,
but not when it is part of the command, e.g. inside a string.

The character " (the double quote mark) starts a comment in legacy script.
This involves some cleverness to make sure double quoted strings are not
recognized as comments (just one reason to prefer |Vim9| script).

There is a little "catch" with comments for some commands.  Examples: >

	abbrev dev development	# shorthand
	map <F3> o#include	# insert include
	execute cmd		# do it
	!ls *.c			# list C files

- The abbreviation 'dev' will be expanded to 'development  # shorthand'.
- The mapping of <F3> will actually be the whole line after the 'o# ....'
  including the '# insert include'.
- The `execute` command will give an error.
- The `!` command will send everything after it to the shell, most likely
  causing an error.

There can be no comment after `map`, `abbreviate`, `execute` and `!` commands
(there are a few more commands with this restriction).  For the `map`,
`abbreviate` and `execute` commands there is a trick: >

	abbrev dev development|# shorthand
	map <F3> o#include|# insert include
	execute '!ls *.c'	|# do it

With the '|' character the command is separated from the next one.  And that
next command is only a comment.  The last command, using `execute` is a
general solution, it works for all commands that do not accept a comment or a
'|' to separate the next command.

Notice that there is no white space before the '|' in the abbreviation and
mapping.  For these commands, any character until the end-of-line or '|' is
included.  As a consequence of this behavior, you don't always see that
trailing whitespace is included: >

	map <F4> o#include  

Here it is intended, in other cases it might be accidental.  To spot these
problems, you can highlight trailing spaces: >
	match Search /\s\+$/

For Unix there is one special way to comment a line, that allows making a Vim
script executable, and it also works in legacy script: >
	#!/usr/bin/env vim -S
	echo "this is a Vim script"
	quit

==============================================================================
*41.12*	Fileformat

The end-of-line character depends on the system.  For Vim scripts it is
recommended to always use the Unix fileformat.  Lines are then separated with
the Newline character.  This also works on any other system.  That way you can
copy your Vim scripts from MS-Windows to Unix and they still work.  See
|:source_crnl|.  To be sure it is set right, do this before writing the file:
>
	:setlocal fileformat=unix

When using "dos" fileformat, lines are separated with CR-NL, two characters.
The CR character causes various problems, better avoid this.
