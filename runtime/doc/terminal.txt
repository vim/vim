Terminal window support					*terminal*


WARNING: THIS IS ONLY PARTLY IMPLEMENTED, ANYTHING CAN STILL CHANGE

The terminal feature is optional, use this to check if your Vim has it: >
	echo has('terminal')
If the result is "1" you have it.


1. Basic use			|terminal-use|
2. Remote testing		|terminal-testing|
3. Debugging			|terminal-debug|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Basic use						*terminal-use*

This feature is for running a terminal emulator in a Vim window.  A job can be
started connected to the terminal emulator. For example, to run a shell: >
     :term bash

Or to run a debugger: >
     :term gdb vim

The job runs asynchronously from Vim, the window will be updated to show
output from the job, also  while editing in any other window.


Typing ~

When the keyboard focus is in the terminal window, typed keys will be sent to
the job.  This uses a pty when possible.  You can click outside of the
terminal window to move keyboard focus elsewhere.

CTRL-W can be used to navigate between windows and other CTRL-W commands, e.g.:
	CTRL-W CTRL-W 	move focus to the next window
	CTRL-W :	enter an Ex command
See |CTRL-W| for more commands.

Special in the terminal window:			*CTRL-W_.*  *CTRL-W_N* 
	CTRL-W .	send a CTRL-W to the job in the terminal
	CTRL-W N	go to Terminal-Normal mode, see |Terminal-mode|
	CTRL-\ CTRL-N   go to Terminal-Normal mode, see |Terminal-mode|
	CTRL-W " {reg}  paste register {reg}		*CTRL-W_quote*
			Also works with the = register to insert the result of
			evaluating an expression.

See option 'termkey' for specifying another key instead of CTRL-W that
will work like CTRL-W.  However, typing 'termkey' twice sends 'termkey' to
the job.  For example:
	'termkey' CTRL-W    move focus to the next window
	'termkey' :	    enter an Ex command
	'termkey' 'termkey' send 'termkey' to the job in the terminal
	'termkey' .	    send a CTRL-W to the job in the terminal
	'termkey' N  	    go to terminal Normal mode, see below
	'termkey' CTRL-N    same as CTRL-W N
							*t_CTRL-\_CTRL-N*
The special key combination CTRL-\ CTRL-N can be used to switch to Normal
mode, just like this works in any other mode.

							*t_CTRL-C*
When |CTRL-C| in the terminal, interrupt signal will be sent to the job.
If you use Windows, |CTRL-C| with shift key terminate the job.

Size ~

See option 'termsize' for controlling the size of the terminal window.
(TODO: scrolling when the terminal is larger than the window)


Syntax ~

:[range]ter[minal] [options] [command]			*:ter* *:terminal*
			Open a new terminal window.

			If [command] is provided run it as a job and connect
			the input and output to the terminal.
			If [command] is not given the 'shell' option is used.

			A new buffer will be created, using [command] or
			'shell' as the name, prefixed with a "!".  If a buffer
			by this name already exists a number is added in
			parentheses.  E.g. if "gdb" exists the second terminal
			buffer will use "!gdb (1)".

			If [range] is given it is used for the terminal size.
			One number specifies the number of rows.  Unless the
			"vertical" modifier is used, then it is the number of
			columns.

			Two comma separated numbers are used as "rows,cols".
			E.g. `:24,80gdb` opens a terminal with 24 rows and 80
			columns.  However, if the terminal window spans the
			Vim window with, there is no vertical split, the Vim
			window width is used.
						*term++close* *term++open*
			Supported [options] are:
			++close		The terminal window will close
					automatically when the job terminates.
			++open		When the job terminates and no window
					shows it, a window will be opened.
					Note that this can be interruptive.
			++curwin	Open the terminal in the current
					window, do not split the current
					window.  Fails if the current buffer
					cannot be |abandon|ed.
			++hidden	Open the terminal in a hidden buffer,
					no window will be used.

			If you want to use more options use the |term_start()|
			function.

When the buffer associated with the terminal is wiped out the job is killed,
similar to calling `job_stop(job, "kill")`

By default the 'bufhidden' option of the buffer will be set to "hide".
So long as the job is running: If the window is closed the buffer becomes
hidden.  The command will not be stopped.  The `:buffer` command can be used
to turn the current window into a terminal window.  If there are unsaved
changes this fails, use ! to force, as usual.

To have a background job run without a window, and open the window when it's
done, use options like this: >
	:term ++hidden ++open make
Note that the window will open at an unexpected moment, this will interrupt
what you are doing.

							*E947*
So long as the job is running, the buffer is considered modified and Vim
cannot be quit easily, see |abandon|.

When the job has finished and no changes were made to the buffer: closing the
window will wipe out the buffer.

Before changes can be made to a terminal buffer, the 'modifiable' option must
be set.  This is only possible when the job has finished.  At the first change
the buffer will become a normal buffer and the highlighting is removed.
You may want to change the buffer name with |:file| to be able to write, since
the buffer name will still be set to the command.


Resizing ~

The size of the terminal can be in one of three modes:

1. The 'termsize' option is empty: The terminal size follows the window size.
   The minimal size is 2 screen lines with 10 cells.

2. The 'termsize' option is "rows*cols", where "rows" is the minimal number of
   screen rows and "cols" is the minimal number of cells.

3. The 'termsize' option is "rowsXcols" (where the x is upper or lower case).
   The terminal size is fixed to the specified number of screen lines and
   cells.  If the window is bigger there will be unused empty space.

If the window is smaller than the terminal size, only part of the terminal can
be seen (the lower-left part).

The |term_getsize()| function can be used to get the current size of the
terminal.  |term_setsize()| can be used only when in the first or second mode,
not when 'termsize' is "rowsXcols".


Terminal-Job and Terminal-Normal mode ~
							*Terminal-mode*
When the job is running the contents of the terminal is under control of the
job.  That includes the cursor position.  Typed keys are sent to the job.
The terminal contents can change at any time.  This is called Terminal-Job
mode.

Use CTRL-W N (or 'termkey' N) to switch to Terminal-Normal mode.  Now the
contents of the terminal window is under control of Vim, the job output is
suspended.  CTRL-\ CTRL-N does the same.
							*E946*
In Terminal-Normal mode you can move the cursor around with the usual Vim
commands, Visually mark text, yank text, etc.  But you cannot change the
contents of the buffer.  The commands that would start insert mode, such as
'i' and 'a', return to Terminal-Job mode.  The window will be updated to show
the contents of the terminal.

In Terminal-Normal mode the statusline and window title show "(Terminal)".  If
the job ends while in Terminal-Normal mode this changes to
"(Terminal-finished)".


Unix ~

On Unix a pty is used to make it possible to run all kinds of commands.  You
can even run Vim in the terminal!  That's used for debugging, see below.

Environment variables are used to pass information to the running job:
    TERM		name of the terminal, 'term'
    ROWS		number of rows in the terminal initially
    LINES		same as ROWS
    COLUMNS		number of columns in the terminal initially
    COLORS		number of colors, 't_Co' (256*256*256 in the GUI)
    VIM_SERVERNAME	v:servername

The |client-server| feature can be used to communicate with the Vim instance
where the job was started.  This only works when v:servername is not empty.
If needed you can set it with: >
	call remote_startserver('vim-server')

In the job you can then do something like: >
	vim --servername $VIM_SERVERNAME --remote +123 some_file.c
This will open the file "some_file.c" and put the cursor on line 123.


MS-Windows ~

On MS-Windows winpty is used to make it possible to run all kind of commands.
Obviously, they must be commands that run in a terminal, not open their own
window.

You need the following two files from winpty:

    winpty.dll
    winpty-agent.exe

You can download them from the following page:

    https://github.com/rprichard/winpty

Just put the files somewhere in your PATH.

==============================================================================
2. Remote testing					*terminal-testing*

Most Vim tests execute a script inside Vim.  For some tests this does not
work, running the test interferes with the code being tested.  To avoid this
Vim is executed in a terminal window.  The test sends keystrokes to it and
inspects the resulting screen state.

Functions ~

term_sendkeys()		send keystrokes to a terminal
term_wait()		wait for screen to be updated
term_scrape()		inspect terminal screen


==============================================================================
3. Debugging					*terminal-debug*

The Terminal debugging plugin can be used to debug a program with gdb and view
the source code in a Vim window. For example: >

	:TermDebug vim

This opens three windows:
- A terminal window in which "gdb vim" is executed.  Here you can directly
  interact with gdb.
- A terminal window for the executed program.  When "run" is used in gdb the
  program I/O will happen in this window, so that it does not interfere with
  controlling gdb.
- A normal Vim window used to show the source code.  When gdb jumps to a
  source file location this window will display the code, if possible.  Values
  of variables can be inspected, breakpoints set and cleared, etc.

This uses two terminal windows.  To open the gdb window: >
	:term gdb [arguments]
To open the terminal to run the tested program |term_start()| is used.
