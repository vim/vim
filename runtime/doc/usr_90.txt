				Installing Vim

								*install*
Before you can use Vim you have to install it.  Depending on your system it's
simple or easy.  This chapter gives a few hints and also explains how
upgrading to a new version is done.

==============================================================================
*90.1*	Unix

First you have to decide if you are going to install Vim system-wide or for a
single user.  The installation is almost the same, but the directory where Vim
is installed in differs.
   For a system-wide installation the base directory "/usr/local" is often
used.  But this may be different for your system.  Try finding out where other
packages are installed.
   When installing for a single user, you can use your home directory as the
base.  The files will be placed in subdirectories like "bin" and "share/vim".


FROM A PACKAGE

Depending on the Unix/Linux system used, there may exist pre-compiled binary
packages.  You need to search for this. We used to keep a list for different
UNIX systems, but that list was outdated so the list was removed.

It is a good idea to compile your own UNIX version from the source.  Also,
creating the editor from the source allows you to control which features are
compiled.  This does require a compiler though.

If you have a Linux distribution, the "vi" program is probably a minimal
version of Vim.  It doesn't do syntax highlighting, for example.  Try finding
another Vim package in your distribution, or search on the web site.


FROM SOURCES

To compile and install Vim, you will need the following:

	-  A C compiler (GCC or clang preferred)
	-  git (optionally, only when cloning from github)
	-  zip/unzip (to uncompress the archive)
	-  The Vim source archives

To download the Vim source, you can either clone it from the Github project
page: >
	git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
<
or download the archive directly using:

	https://github.com/vim/vim/archive/refs/heads/master.zip


COMPILING

First create a top directory to work in, for example: >

	mkdir ~/vim
	cd ~/vim

Then unpack the archives there.  You can unpack it like this: >

	unzip vim-master.zip

If you are satisfied with getting the default features, and your environment
is setup properly, you should be able to compile Vim with just this: >

	cd vim-master/src
	make

The make program will run configure and compile everything.  Further on we
will explain how to compile with different features.
   If there are errors while compiling, carefully look at the error messages.
There should be a hint about what went wrong.  Hopefully you will be able to
correct it.  You might have to disable some features to make Vim compile.
Look in the Makefile for specific hints for your system.


TESTING

Now you can check if compiling worked OK: >

	make test

This will run a sequence of test scripts to verify that Vim works as expected.
Vim will be started many times and all kinds of text and messages flash by.
If it is alright you will finally see:

	test results: ~
	ALL DONE ~

If you get "TEST FAILURE" some test failed.  If there are one or two messages
about failed tests, Vim might still work, but not perfectly.  If you see a lot
of error messages or Vim doesn't finish until the end, there must be something
wrong.  Either try to find out yourself, or find someone who can solve it.
You could look in the |maillist-archive| for a solution.  If everything else
fails, you could ask in the vim |maillist| if someone can help you.


INSTALLING
							*install-home*
If you want to install in your home directory, edit the Makefile and search
for a line:

	#prefix = $(HOME) ~

Remove the # at the start of the line.
   When installing for the whole system, Vim has most likely already selected
a good installation directory for you.  You can also specify one, see below.
You need to become root for the following.

To install Vim do: >

	make install

That should move all the relevant files to the right place.  Now you can try
running vim to verify that it works.  Use two simple tests to check if Vim can
find its runtime files: >

	:help
	:syntax enable

If this doesn't work, use this command to check where Vim is looking for the
runtime files: >

	:echo $VIMRUNTIME

You can also start Vim with the "-V" argument to see what happens during
startup: >

	vim -V

Don't forget that the user manual assumes you Vim in a certain way.  After
installing Vim, follow the instructions at |not-compatible| to make Vim work
as assumed in this manual.


SELECTING FEATURES

Vim has many ways to select features.  One of the simple ways is to edit the
Makefile.  There are many directions and examples.  Often you can enable or
disable a feature by uncommenting a line.
   An alternative is to run "configure" separately.  This allows you to
specify configuration options manually.  The disadvantage is that you have to
figure out what exactly to type.
   Some of the most interesting configure arguments follow.  These can also be
enabled from the Makefile.

	--prefix={directory}		Top directory where to install Vim.

	--with-features=tiny		Compile with some features disabled.
	--with-features=normal		Compile with more features enabled.
	--with-features=huge		Compile with most features enabled.
					See |+feature-list| for which feature
					is enabled in which case.

	--enable-perlinterp		Enable the Perl interface.  There are
					similar arguments for ruby, python and
					tcl.

	--disable-gui			Do not compile the GUI interface.
	--without-x			Do not compile X-windows features.
					When both of these are used, Vim will
					not connect to the X server, which
					makes startup faster.

To see the whole list use: >

	./configure --help

You can find a bit of explanation for each feature, and links for more
information here: |feature-list|.
   For the adventurous, edit the file "feature.h".  You can also change the
source code yourself!

==============================================================================
*90.2*	MS-Windows

There are several ways to install the Vim program for Microsoft Windows:

    1. Official Website Download (Stable)~

Visit the official Vim website at https://www.vim.org to download the latest
stable version. The site links to the Windows installer that works out of the
box for most users.

    2. Using winget (Windows Package Manager) ~

If you prefer using the command line, you can quickly install Vim using
Windows built-in package manager for the stable version: >

	winget install vim.vim

Or to download the latest nightly version, use: >

	winget install vim.vim.nightly

This method ensures you get an up-to-date version with minimal hassle.

    3. GitHub Installer (All Architectures) ~

For more control over the installation (or if you're using a specific CPU
architecture like ARM), visit the official GitHub repository:

	https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/

This repo provides daily installer and portable zip archives for:

    - x86 (32-bit)
    - x64 (64-bit)
    - ARM64

It's a great option if you want nightly builds or specific configuration

In case you are not satisfied with the features included in the supplied
binaries, you could try compiling Vim yourself.  Get the source archive from
the same location as where the binaries are.  You need a compiler for which a
makefile exists.  Microsoft Visual C, MinGW and Cygwin compilers can be used.
Check the file src/INSTALLpc.txt for hints.  You can get the source from:

	https://github.com/vim/vim

==============================================================================
*90.3*	Upgrading

If you are running one version of Vim and want to install another, here is
what to do.


UNIX

When you type "make install" the runtime files will be copied to a directory
which is specific for this version.  Thus they will not overwrite a previous
version.  This makes it possible to use two or more versions next to
each other.
   The executable "vim" will overwrite an older version.  If you don't care
about keeping the old version, running "make install" will work fine.  You can
delete the old runtime files manually.  Just delete the directory with the
version number in it and all files below it.  Example: >

	rm -rf /usr/local/share/vim/vim74

There are normally no changed files below this directory.  If you did change
the "filetype.vim" file, for example, you better merge the changes into the
new version before deleting it.

If you are careful and want to try out the new version for a while before
switching to it, install the new version under another name.  You need to
specify a configure argument.  For example: >

	./configure --with-vim-name=vim8

Before running "make install", you could use "make -n install" to check that
no valuable existing files are overwritten.
   When you finally decide to switch to the new version, all you need to do is
to rename the binary to "vim".  For example: >

	mv /usr/local/bin/vim8 /usr/local/bin/vim


MS-WINDOWS

Upgrading is mostly equal to installing a new version.  Just unpack the files
in the same place as the previous version.  A new directory will be created,
e.g., "vim82", for the files of the new version.  Your runtime files, vimrc
file, viminfo, etc. will be left alone.
   If you want to run the new version next to the old one, you will have to do
some handwork.  Don't run the install program, it will overwrite a few files
of the old version.  Execute the new binaries by specifying the full path.
The program should be able to automatically find the runtime files for the
right version.  However, this won't work if you set the $VIMRUNTIME variable
somewhere.
   If you are satisfied with the upgrade, you can delete the files of the
previous version.  See |90.5|.

==============================================================================
*90.4*	Common installation issues

This section describes some of the common problems that occur when installing
Vim and suggests some solutions.  It also contains answers to many
installation questions.


Q: I Do Not Have Root Privileges.  How Do I Install Vim? (Unix)

Use the following configuration command to install Vim in a directory called
$HOME/vim: >

	./configure --prefix=$HOME

This gives you a personal copy of Vim.  You need to put $HOME/bin in your
path to execute the editor.  Also see |install-home|.


Q: The Colors Are Not Right on My Screen. (Unix)

Check your terminal settings by using the following command in a shell: >

	echo $TERM

If the terminal type listed is not correct, fix it.  For more hints, see
|06.2|.  Another solution is to always use the GUI version of Vim, called
gvim.  This avoids the need for a correct terminal setup.


Q: My Backspace And Delete Keys Don't Work Right

The definition of what key sends what code is very unclear for backspace <BS>
and Delete <Del> keys.  First of all, check your $TERM setting.  If there is
nothing wrong with it, try this: >

	:set t_kb=^V<BS>
	:set t_kD=^V<Del>

In the first line you need to press CTRL-V and then hit the backspace key.
In the second line you need to press CTRL-V and then hit the Delete key.
You can put these lines in your vimrc file, see |05.1|.  A disadvantage is
that it won't work when you use another terminal some day.  Look here for
alternate solutions: |:fixdel|.


Q: I Am Using RedHat Linux.  Can I Use the Vim That Comes with the System?

By default RedHat installs a minimal version of Vim.  Check your RPM packages
for something named "Vim-enhanced-version.rpm" and install that.


Q: How Do I Turn Syntax Coloring On?  How do I make plugins work?

Use the example vimrc script.  You can find an explanation on how to use it
here: |not-compatible|.

See chapter 6 for information about syntax highlighting: |usr_06.txt|.


Q: What Is a Good vimrc File to Use?

See the www.vim.org Web site for several good examples.


Q: Where Do I Find a Good Vim Plugin?

See the Vim-online site: http://vim.sf.net.  Many users have uploaded useful
Vim scripts and plugins there.


Q: Where Do I Find More Tips?

See the Vim-online site: http://vim.sf.net.  There is an archive with hints
from Vim users.  You might also want to search in the |maillist-archive|.

==============================================================================
*90.5*	Uninstalling Vim

In the unlikely event you want to uninstall Vim completely, this is how you do
it.


UNIX

When you installed Vim as a package, check your package manager to find out
how to remove the package again.
   If you installed Vim from sources you can use this command: >

	make uninstall

However, if you have deleted the original files or you used an archive that
someone supplied, you can't do this.  Do delete the files manually, here is an
example for when "/usr/local" was used as the root: >

	rm -rf /usr/local/share/vim/vim82
	rm /usr/local/bin/eview
	rm /usr/local/bin/evim
	rm /usr/local/bin/ex
	rm /usr/local/bin/gview
	rm /usr/local/bin/gvim
	rm /usr/local/bin/gvim
	rm /usr/local/bin/gvimdiff
	rm /usr/local/bin/rgview
	rm /usr/local/bin/rgvim
	rm /usr/local/bin/rview
	rm /usr/local/bin/rvim
	rm /usr/local/bin/rvim
	rm /usr/local/bin/view
	rm /usr/local/bin/vim
	rm /usr/local/bin/vimdiff
	rm /usr/local/bin/vimtutor
	rm /usr/local/bin/xxd
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/eview.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/evim.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/ex.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/gview.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/gvim.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/gvimdiff.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/rgview.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/rgvim.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/rview.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/rvim.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/view.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/vim.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/vimdiff.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/vimtutor.1
	rm /usr/local/man/man1/xxd.1


MS-WINDOWS

If you installed Vim with the self-installing archive you can run
the "uninstall-gui" program located in the same directory as the other Vim
programs, e.g. "c:\vim\vim82".  You can also launch it from the Start menu if
installed the Vim entries there.  This will remove most of the files, menu
entries and desktop shortcuts.  Some files may remain however, as they need a
Windows restart before being deleted.
   You will be given the option to remove the whole "vim" directory.  It
probably contains your vimrc file and other runtime files that you created, so
be careful.

Else, if you installed Vim with the zip archives, the preferred way is to use
the "uninstall" program.  You can find it in the same directory as the
"install" program, e.g., "c:\vim\vim82".  This should also work from the usual
"install/remove software" page.
   However, this only removes the registry entries for Vim.  You have to
delete the files yourself.  Simply select the directory "vim\vim82" and delete
it recursively.  There should be no files there that you changed, but you
might want to check that first.
   The "vim" directory probably contains your vimrc file and other runtime
files that you created.  You might want to keep that.
