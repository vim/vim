2. Usage					*zip-usage* *zip-manual*

   When one edits a *.zip file, this plugin will handle displaying a
   contents page.  Select a file to edit by moving the cursor atop
   the desired file, then hit the <return> key.  After editing, one may
   also write to the file.  Currently, one may not make a new file in
   zip archives via the plugin.

3. History					*zip-history*
   v8 Apr 10, 2006 * Bram Moolenaar reported that he received an error message
		     due to "Pattern not found: ^.*\%0c"; this was caused by
		     stridx finding a Name... at the beginning of the line;
		     zip.vim tried 4,$s/^.*\%0c//, but that doesn't work.
		     Fixed.
   v7 Mar 22, 2006 * escaped some characters that can cause filename handling
		     problems.
