This file used to contain the particularities for the MS-DOS version of Vim.
MS-DOS support was removed in patch 7.4.1399.  If you want to use it you will
need to get a version older than that.  Note that the MS-DOS version doesn't
work, there is not enough memory.  The DOS32 version (using DJGPP) might still
work on older systems.
