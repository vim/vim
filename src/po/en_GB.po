# Style Guide:
# o English spelling!
# o Colour, not color
# o -ise, not -ize.
# o No contractions.
# o Cannot, not can not.
# o Backward (no s) when used as an adjective.
# o Consistent capitalisation for first word after Ennn:
# o Consistent capitalisation of NetBeans and JSON
# o TBC ...
#
# As with all guides, they should be followed unless there is a reason why they
# should not be for a particular message.
