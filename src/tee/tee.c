 *
 * tee.c - pipe fitting
 *
 * tee reads stdin, and writes what it reads to each of the specified
 * files. The primary reason of existence for this version is a quick
 * and dirty implementation to distribute with Vim, to make one of the
 * most useful features of Vim possible on OS/2: quickfix.
 *
 * Of course, not using tee but instead redirecting make's output directly
 * into a temp file and then processing that is possible, but if we have a
 * system capable of correctly piping (unlike DOS, for example), why not
 * use it as well as possible? This tee should also work on other systems,
 * but it's not been tested there, only on OS/2.
 *
 * tee is also available in the GNU shellutils package, which is available
 * precompiled for OS/2. That one probably works better.
